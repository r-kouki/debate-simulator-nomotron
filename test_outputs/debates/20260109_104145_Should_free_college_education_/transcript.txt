--- ROUND 1 ---

PRO:
Pro: Free college education is a vital investment in our future workforce, providing affordable higher education to the masses and promoting social mobility. It encourages diversity and equity, ensuring that everyone has equal access to knowledge and opportunities. Research shows that students from low-income backgrounds who attend college tend to earn higher wages and have greater life satisfaction. Furthermore, studies indicate that investing in free college education can stimulate economic growth and create new jobs. Therefore, it's crucial to prioritize free college education as a cornerstone of our education system.

CON:
Con: While free college education benefits some, it is not a fair or sustainable solution for all. High costs and limited access create inequality, with only a small percentage of students able to afford such an education. This perpetuates systemic issues, as only those from wealthier families can afford to invest in their future. Moreover, diverting funds from public education to free college programs could lead to cuts in K-12 schools, further exacerbating disparities and hindering the education of younger students. A more equitable approach would be to improve funding for K-12 schools and provide affordable support for college programs, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to succeed.
