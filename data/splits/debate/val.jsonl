What is missing in both Bauman and Foucault is a sense of the difference that colonialism or Empire makes to the ways in which power, politics and knowledge combine and work out their effects on the landscape of social change. Spivak has reminded us of the 'sanctioned ignorance' and occlusion of the colonial and imperial moment in Western post-structuralist thinking. The ways in which non-Western others have been and continue to be represented is reflected in a range of subordinating forms of classification, surveillance, negation, appropriation and debasement, as contrasted to a positive self-affirmation of Western identity As has been outlined above, Euro-Americanism exemplifies many of the problems associated with the depiction and representation of non-Western societies, and the elements I mentioned in that section could be considered in a geopolitical setting as having three interwoven components - representations of: a) the other, e.g. the Third World; b) the self, e.g. the First World and, c) the interrelations between self and other, e.g. First World/Third World relations. geopolitics of representation focus on (a) and (c) so that in the example of dependency perspectives the critical assessment of modernization theory focused on the inadequate portrayal of Third World reality and the overly sanguine depiction of First World-Third World relations whereas the image drawn of the First World self was subjected to much less critical scrutiny These three intersecting components, need to be borne in mind in the development of any critique of the state of North-South relations and they can be seen as an important part of any post-colonial perspective the post-colonial seeks to question Western discourses of, for example, progress, civilization, modernization, development and democracy, by making connections with the continuing relevance of invasive colonial and imperial power that these discourses tend to evade The post-colonial can be used to pose a series of questions concerning the location and differential impact of the agents of knowledge a post-colonial perspective challenges the pervasive tendency to ignore the contributions of African, Asian and Latin American intellectuals and their counter-representations of West/non-West relations as a mode of analysis, the post-colonial seeks to give key attention to the 'centrality of the periphery' the post-colonial in terms of the way I interpret it in this text carries with it an ethico-political positionality that seeks to oppose the coloniality and imperiality of power and re-assert the salience of autonomy and popular resistance to Western penetrations\nInstead of accepting a Euro-American mindset of thinking of the “third world” as the “other” and subjecting the non-Western countries to subordination, accept the postcolonial mindset of rejecting the Western narrative.\nSlater 2004 (David, Professor of Social and Political Geography at Loughborough University, “Geopolitics and the Post-colonial: Rethinking North-South Relations”, p 19-21)", "metadata": {"topic": "Kritiks", "citation": "Slater 2004 (David, Professor of Social and Political Geography at Loughborough University, “Geopolitics and the Post-colonial: Rethinking North-South Relations”, p 19-21)", "camp": "Gonzaga (GDI)", "tag": "Kritiks", "year": "2013", "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:10Z"}

This desire of ‘becoming-Other’ is mirrored in the colonizer a mutual desire of destruction The colonizer would like nothing better than to annihilate the colonized However, this annihilation would result in suicide The labour power of the colonized is required in order for the colony to be viable. Similarly, the logic of the colonized is couched in the capacity of swallowing the colonizer through numbers. This marks the beginning of anti-colonial violence and decolonization not just of land, but also of mind and body. Anti-colonial violence is a self-rehabilitation of the oppressed in directly confronting the source of his dehumanization expressed through the act of violence violence demonstrates to the colonized that the colonial structures are not impervious to harm, and that her inferiority, entrenched through colonial ideology, is not essential. What becomes essential is that both colonized and colonizer are mortal, through action against the symbols of colonialism, the colonized becomes man this ‘becoming man’ by no means corresponds to a simple desire for recognition by the colonizer, or to fit within the category of ‘man’ as determined by universal humanism. The necessary violence to which the colonized resorts is a process of becoming. Through this process, the colonized becomes an agent, experiences that which is required to realize oneself in the world Through this violence there transpires a mutual transformation of both sides of the previously Manichean binary accompanied by the blossoming of a ‘national consciousness’ which is neither exclusionary nor a refounding of the violent structures of the state. anti-colonial violence as presented by Fanon is “utterly beyond good and evil does not avail of a self-justifying meta-narrative the initial expressions of anticolonial violence have no ends in mind this is violence as pure means, as pure expression, as pure anger, it has “no other aim than to show and show itself Anti-colonial violence destroys the colonial law, the expression of universal humanism, through demonstrating its untenable inconsistencies. The boundaries of the colonial state are destroyed ). The boundaries between colonizer and colonized are likewise destroyed. each becomes no less mortal than the other the “enterprise of mystification” practiced by the “demagogues, opportunists, magicians” becomes “practically impossible” The violence against the colonial structure pits divine violence against mythic violence; as the thousands of colonized are felled by machine gun fire, the founding mythic violence of the colonial state works against itself Its arbitrary nature becomes clear through its constant shedding of representative blood. Each victim of colonial violence represents all colonized individuals, in the consciousness of the colonizer and colonized. For the colonizer this is because the shapeless masses of the colonized are indistinguishable one from the other; for the colonized, colonial massacres work as the threat principle of the state. In this orgy of violence, which is at once both founding and preserving, the colonial state drives itself towards suicide. The foundational becomes all the more present in each preservation of order, and necessarily demystifies the foundation of the colonial state from the sheer quotidian presence of mythic fate. Each victim of anticolonial violence, however, is killed without warning, without threat. Anti-colonial violence does not threaten, and is never arbitrary. This violence is expiatory: through his death, the colonizer receives the capacity for atonement for his complicity in the violence of the colonial structure. anti-colonial “violence is exercised on all life but to the profit of for the sake of the livin national bourgeoisie and nationalist political parties, attempt to pacify the colonized These work to re-orient the violence of the colonized towards a non-radical, passive acceptance prevention of the founding of a new ‘apparatus of exploitation’ is only possible through the inculcation of a national consciousness. This denies the accumulation of power, of the foundational violence of the state through a horizontal spread of capacity, responsibility and agency. This links with the mutual recognition achieved through the transformative process of anti-colonial violence, and with Derrida’s requirement of a recognition of the unique in any possible non-violent politics.\nIn the colonial situation a desire of the Colony to destroy the colonized perpetuates a system of violence-only resisting the desire to become colonizer can the violence be overthrown through a symbolic upheaval.\nKrebs 07 (Andreas Krebs, Phd University of Ottawa,“The Transcendent and the Postcolonial Violence in Derrida and Fanon”,pg. 93, BW)", "metadata": {"topic": "Kritiks", "citation": "Krebs 07 (Andreas Krebs, Phd University of Ottawa,“The Transcendent and the Postcolonial Violence in Derrida and Fanon”,pg. 93, BW)", "camp": "Gonzaga (GDI)", "tag": "Kritiks", "year": "2013", "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:10Z"}

Edward Said will not let us forget that the \"ethnocentric and erratic will to power from which texts can spring\"19 is itself a theater of war. Mimicry, as the metonymy of presence is, indeed, such an erratic, eccentric strategy of authority in colonial discourse. Mimicry does not merely destroy narcissistic authority through the repetitious slippage of difference and desire. It is the process of thefixation of the colonial as a form of cross-classificatory, discriminatory knowledge in the defiles of an interdictory discourse, and therefore necessarily raises the question of the authorizationo f colonial representations. A question of authority that goes beyond the subject's lack of priority (castration) to a historical crisis in the conceptuality of colonial man as an object of regulatory power, as the subject of racial, cultural, national representation. This culture . . . fixed in its colonial status There is a crucial difference between this colonial articulation of man and his doubles and that which Foucault describes as \"thinking the unthought\"21 which, for nineteenth-century Europe, is the ending of man's alienation by reconciling him with his essence. The colonial discourse that articulates an interdictory\" otherness\" is precisely the \"other scene\" of this nineteenth-century European desire for an authentic historical consciousness. The \"unthought\" across which colonial man is articulated is that process of classificatory confusion that I have described as the metonymy of the substitutive chain of ethical and cultural discourse. This results in the splitting of colonial discourse so that two attitudes towards external reality persist; one takes reality into consideration while the other disavows it and replaces it by a product of desire that repeats, rearticulates \"reality\" as mimicry. Such contradictory articulations of reality and desire--seen in racist stereotypes, statements, jokes, myths- are not caught in the doubtful circle of the return of the repressed. They are the effects of a disavowal that denies the differences of the other but produces in its stead forms of authority and multiple belief that alienate the assumptions of \"civil\" discourse. colonial power can be seen the twin figures of narcissism and paranoia that repeat furiously, uncontrollably. In the ambivalent world of the \"not quite/not white,\" the founding objects of the Western world become the erratic, eccentric, accidental objets trouves of the colonial discourse .

It might well be that postcolonial criticism never intended to address directly the myriad problems of analyzing Third-World societies, but rather has been fascinated with theorizing structures of power and, by extension, the critic's position vis-a-vis these structures. No coloniality, no postcoloniality, just ruminations on fantasies of power. Postcolonial studies of this genre strike the old-fashioned pose of the European psychoanalyst who unmasks the cultural crime of deformation. They are based on the virtually self-explanatory phenomenon of cultural struggle and adjustment. Since the postcolonial subject/critic is someone with access to positional knowledge, the work of generations of nonpostcolonial scholars is not particularly important. Even those who made a genuine effort to bring cultures formerly called \"Oriental\" into the Euro-American continuum need not be examined. The postcolonial critic can dismiss this work as serving a decrepit ideology Often the postcolonial critic is unaware that a body of scholarship written by area specialists pertaining to the topic even exists.

It is true that the location of critics does not necessarily diminish their message. However, being rooted to the territory of one's origin also does not assure a \"pure and authentic standpoint\" The problem is one of representation. Auto-minoritized subjects assume roles as spokespersons for minority communities. Regardless of their own socio-economic status and privileges, they speak as/ for minorities and as representatives for a minority community and its victimization.

Governments that are popularly elected and respect human rights and the rule of law are less dangerous to both their citizens and their neighbors. Nations which are substantively democratic tend not to go to war with one another. They are also less vulnerable to the threat of internal war provoked, in part, by government violence and illegality.(5) In short, democracy and economic integration are not simply value preferences, but are increasingly bound up with hemispheric security. To take just one example: The restoration of democracy in Brazil and Argentina and their increasingly strong and profitable relationship in Mercosur have contributed in no small degree to their decisions to foresake the development of nuclear weapons. Perceptions of threat have declined, and perceptions of the benefits of cooperation have grown, and this has permitted progress on a range of security issues As a result of political leadership transitions in both countries, Brazil and Argentina appear firmly committed to restricting their nuclear programs to peaceful purposes Even so, no one can be certain about the future. the military application of Brazil’s nuclear and space programs depends less on technological considerations than on political will. changes in political leadership were instrumental in redirecting Brazil’s nuclear program towards peaceful purposes, future political upheavals could still produce a reversion to previous orientations. Civilian supremacy is not so strong that it could not be swept away by a coup, especially if the legitimacy of the current democratic experiment were to be undermined Brazil would have a capability three times greater than India or Pakistan That government would need foreign enemies to help justify it’s existence. One obvious candidate would be the U S Abreu threatened to transform the region into a “new Vietnam” if developed countries tried to “internationalize” the Amazon Economic conflicts could lead to heightened politico-military rivalry between different blocs or coalitions in the hemisphere.\nDemocratic backsliding in Latin America causes regional proliferation and nuclear conflict\nSchulz 2k (Donald Schulz, Chairman of the Political Science Department at Cleveland State University, March 2000, The United States and Latin America: Shaping an Elusive Future, http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub31.pdf)", "metadata": {"topic": "Affirmatives", "citation": "Schulz 2k (Donald Schulz, Chairman of the Political Science Department at Cleveland State University, March 2000, The United States and Latin America: Shaping an Elusive Future, http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub31.pdf)", "camp": "Northwestern (NHSI)", "tag": "Affirmatives", "year": "2013", "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:10Z"}

In the Cold War arms control accords were important ‘stabilisers’ of the nuclear relationship, but limitations on weapons numbers would seem to be much more difficult when the arsenals are of uneven size, and when the weaker party would probably be relying on secrecy about the numbers and locations of weapons to minimise the vulnerability of their arsenals.\nNew prolif ensures widespread nuclear conflict --- asymmetries\nLyon 9 Program Director, Strategy and International, with Australian Strategic Policy Institute, previously a Senior Lecturer in International Relations at the University of Queensland, “A delicate issue, Asia’s nuclear future”, December, online", "metadata": {"topic": "Affirmatives", "citation": "Lyon 9 Program Director, Strategy and International, with Australian Strategic Policy Institute, previously a Senior Lecturer in International Relations at the University of Queensland, “A delicate issue, Asia’s nuclear future”, December, online", "camp": "Northwestern (NHSI)", "tag": "Affirmatives", "year": "2013", "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:10Z"}

Seen in this light, sovereign power does not pre-exist bare life and neither does bare life pre-exist sovereign power. Instead, sovereign power and bare life must be thought of as co-constitutive of each other. Sovereign power comes to exist only through the constant (re)production of bare life in zones of indistinction that are amenable to its sway: The essence of political power in the West […] is the power to suspend (not apply) law and thus to produce a sphere of beings without quantities, homines sacri, whom every being, insofar as he or she is alive, may be On this basis, it is through the production of homo sacer that the politically qualified life of the polis, necessary for juridical–political order, is ultimately defined and sustained politics must again and again enact its internal distinction from bare life […] it must repeatedly define itself through the negation of bare life – a negation that can always take the form of death this decision relies upon nothing other than the ‘deeming’ of certain forms of life to be ineligible for certain basic the decision to detain, to continue to detain someone indefinitely, is a unilateral judgement made by government officials who simply deem that a given individual, or indeed a group, poses a danger to the state’ Often, the decision leading to the production of bare life is underwritten by so-called national security imperatives defined by a state of emergency: in this way the invocation of the discourse of exceptionalism attempts to legitimise the suspension of national and international law the legitimacy of sovereign power is legitimised by nothing other than its own legitimisation the generalised biopolitical border reconceptualises the (re)production of the juridical–political order is in terms of performance. The sovereign decision that creates bare life is not necessarily a singular act but a reiterative performance: one that leads to the perpetuation of bare life detained indefinitely in camps or left to die in cargo containers at sea borders are continually (re)inscribed through mobile bodies that can be risk assessed, categorised, and then treated as either trusted citizen travellers or bare life. According to the modern geopolitical imaginary, the ‘proper’ political subject is the citizen: ‘bordered’ and autonomous before the law in the same way as the sovereign state of which it is a subject. Thinking in terms of the generalised biopolitical border prompts an alternative line of analysis that redirects emphasis away from the modern bordered citizen the ‘real sovereign subject’ is not the citizen but rather homo sacer: the ‘mute carrier of sovereignty’ defined not by contract or rights but by exposure to the sovereign decision on whether it is deemed life worthy of living. has provocatively argued, concentration camps and refugee camps can be seen as two sides of the same sociological matrix: ‘perhaps the ultimate image of the treatment of the “local population” as homo sacer is that of the American war plane flying above Afghanistan – one is never sure what it will drop, bombs or food parcels’ To a large extent the concept of the border of the state offers a stable and comfortingly coherent means of mapping who, where and what ‘the enemy’ is: it enables the juxtaposition of an immutable realm of warfare and barbarism outside the state on the one hand and the impression of safety, stability and possibility of progress inside the state on the other. Such a picture permits a double designation of ‘the enemy’ so that it is taken to be both outside the state but itself another state which, in , leads to the possibility of a resolution of conflict through classical forms of warfare between sovereign states. concept of the generalised biopolitical border, however, scrambles this conventional logic and the assumed alignment between inside/amity and outside/enmity. Rather than essentialising the enemy as the other outside the state, an Agambenian approach is more attentive to the ways in which different threats are produced as ‘foreign’ or ‘exteriorised’ Rather, as security becomes the ‘basic principle of state activity’ politics is reduced to policing, and lines of amity and enmity are fundamentally blurred. Conflict is no longer between states but potentially between the terroristic state and its citizens who are ‘all virtually homines sacri’.14\nThe affirmative’s geopolitical imaginary is characterized by a wholly enclosed land space of bounded nation-states.

The metaphor is in fact necessary for the continuation of the global racial hierarchy. In the human rights narrative, savages and victims are generally non-white and non-Western, while the saviors are white. there is also a sense in which human rights can be seen as a project for the redemp¬tion of the redeemers, in which whites who are privileged globally as a peo¬ple—who have historically visited untold suffering and savage atrocities against non-whites—redeem themselves by \"defending\" and \"civilizing\" \"lower,\" \"unfortunate,\" and \"inferior\" peoples. The metaphor is thus laced with the pathology of self-redemption the human rights movement will ultimately fail because it is perceived as an alien ideology in non-Western societies. The movement does not deeply resonate in the cultural fabrics of non-Western states, except among hypocritical elites steeped in Western ideas. In order ultimately to prevail, the human rights movement must be moored in the cultures of all peoples. The culture of rights in the present milieu stretches back at least to the rise of the modern state in Europe. It is that state's monopoly of violence and the instruments of coercion that gave rise to the culture of rights to coun-terbalance the abusive state. Human rights, however, renew the meaning and scope of rights in a radical way. Human rights bestow naturalness, transhis- toricity, and universality to rights. The idea of hu¬man rights—the quest to craft a universal bundle of attributes with which all societies must endow all human beings—is a noble one. The problem with the current bundle of attributes lies in their inadequacy, incomplete¬ness, and wrong-headedness.\nHuman rights reinforce racism due to the narrative of the redeemers redeeming themselves by protecting the inferior people.

Much of this was the result of the breakup of European empires But it has also been more broadly the result of the spread of a model of territorial statehood, a state-centered political economy, and the association of democracy with territorial citizenship from Europe into the rest of the world. , the imagination of territorial statehood rests on imitation and diffusion of established political models that define what is and what is not possible in the world European (and, later, American) cultural hegemony has thus ‘written the script’ for the growth and consolidation of a global nation-state system. Previously in world history, a wide range of types of polity co-existed without any one*empire, city-state, nomadic network, dynastic state, or religious polity*serving as the singular model of ‘best political practice’. It is only with the rise of Europe to global predominance that an idealized European territorial state became the global archetype. Lurking behind bordering everywhere is the effect of that nationalism which has come along with the territorial nation-state: that being perpetually in question, national identity has to be constantly re-invented through the mobilization of national populations Borders, provide the essential focus for this collective uncertainty. State borders are not, therefore, simply just another example of, albeit more clearly marked, boundaries. They are qualitatively different in their capacity to both redefine other boundaries and to override more locally-based distinctions They have a specific historical and geographical origin. If social boundaries are universal and transcendental, if varying in their incidence and precise significance, state borders, in the sense of definitive borderlines, certainly are not. They have not been around for time immemorial Attempts to claim that bordering is historic or to take bordering as a given of state formation are, therefore, empirically problematic. What is evident has been the need to give borders a deep-seated historical genealogy even when this is a fictive exercise. There is nothing ‘natural’*physically or socially*to borders. They are literally impositions on the world. borders are never transcendental objects that systematically secure spaces in which identities and interests can go unquestioned. borders frequently transgress rather than celebrate or enable cultural and political difference. the US-Mexican border cuts through historic migration fields and flows of everyday life the Israel-Gaza border is a prison perimeter premised on collective punishment of a population for electing rocket-firing adherents to Hamas; and most borders in the Middle East and Africa make no national or cultural sense whatsoever (e.g. the Somalia-Ethiopia border with more than 4 million Somalis within Ethiopia The perpetual instability of the border is precisely what gives it such symbolic power in the mind’s eye of the nationalists who favor/challenge it.\nThe idea of the border is not a historic concept – rather, boundaries are a result of European influence in the global sphere. They are completely artificial constructions that are not necessarily effective.

On the one hand, and certainly not a novel theme, border porosity is seen as a geopolitical threat; on the other hand, however, there is a growing awareness by law- and policy-makers that a reactionary geopolitics of containment at US borders is likely to threaten America’s trade linkages. We might characterise this as a lateral re-siting of US immigration enforcement away from the border itself: on the one hand, its localisation in US cities, which amounts to a newly intensified surveillance of everyday immigrant life at the urban scale; and on the other hand, its regionalisation south of the Mexico-US border, which as we saw amounts to a pre-infringement, extra-jurisdictional immigration enforcement regime Nonetheless, my contention is that their extension today – as ‘neoliberal rollout’ tactics, designed in effect to protect the ‘rollback’ of the borderland economy engineered in the wake of the 1982 debt crisis – is an attempt to deflate the tension between trade and security directly at the border. Whether or not these ‘rollout’ policies succeed is not my interest. Rather, I want to draw attention to the generalisation of border life throughout a number of previously ‘non-border’ spaces, or in other words how the border and border policing are being reproduced in sites far away from the border proper. Otherwise said, US statecraft no longer accords – if it ever did – to an abstract geopolitics of ‘verticality’ and ‘encompassment’ – verticality meaning from a single point ‘above’, and encompassment meaning over a carefully bordered and territorially contiguous bloc of space. the twin processes of localisation/devolution and regionalisation/preemptionin US immigration geopolitics constitute what we might call a proxy geography of immigration enforcement. Lahav and Guiraudon, in their excellent studies of EU immigration policing, point to a similar process by which state geographies of immigration enforcement in Europe have been reinvented as an ‘extended playing field of local, transnational, and private actors outside the central state apparatus to forestall migration’ I contend, is a nascent tripartite ‘overseas enforcement-border militarisation-interior enforcement’ assemblage. The upshot is what a US immigration official has recently celebrated as ‘a seamless web of enforcement from the interior of the United States to the nation's borders and out to the farthest reaches of source and transit countries that will impact the flow of illegal immigrants to the United States’.117 In this sense, the Mexico-US border is becoming as deep as it is wide.\nIn an attempt to resolve the security/economy contradiction of the US-Mexico border, the United States has expanded the border by localization inwardly and preemption outwardly.\nColeman 7 [Mathew, Associate Professor, Department of Geography, The Ohio State University, A Geopolitics of Engagement:¶ “Neoliberalism, the War on Terrorism,¶ and the Reconfiguration of US¶ Immigration Enforcement,” Geopolitics, 12:607–634, 2007]", "metadata": {"topic": "Kritiks", "citation": "Coleman 7 [Mathew, Associate Professor, Department of Geography, The Ohio State University, A Geopolitics of Engagement:¶ “Neoliberalism, the War on Terrorism,¶ and the Reconfiguration of US¶ Immigration Enforcement,” Geopolitics, 12:607–634, 2007]", "camp": "Texas (UTNIF)", "tag": "Kritiks", "year": "2013", "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:10Z"}

This can produce aggressiveness as the subject focuses on the world rather than its own coherence problem the various displacements and projections through which objects of violence are interpretively selected are at issue, and because this interpretive dynamic operates in relation to the ontological interest of the subject. Just as Hegel took his view of the necessity for negation from the level of the individual to that of the state, we can move the Lacanian model of aggressivity from individual to collectivity. The individual's symbolic participation in national enmities derives from identification with the national body. The nation's coherence producing activities and boundary policing serve to affirm the coherence sought by the individual while at the same time projecting a collective unity that constitutes a denial of social antagonisms and other fragmenting domestic forces. the domestic negotiation of a national identity involves a continuous search for dangerous forms of disorder, various Others whose dangers involve threats that are not exhausted by merely strategic considerations a strong identification with unambiguous boundaries for one's collectivity—that is, a strong demand for a coherent model of national autonomy and difference—can produce adversaries, both within and without. These become national objects of desire; they are both necessary for self-identity and a threat insofar as they reflect a disorder too unacceptable to be recognized as part of one's own order.\nNations seek to reconcile internal aspects of their existence that are contradictory to an ideal national identity that is generated by the creation and reinforcement of boundaries.

Neural beings cannot do that’ The final key point is call the container schema cognitively, humans perceive categories to be containers. Consequently, we imagine categories to have a defi nite inside, boundary, and an outside, like a container Because we cognitively think of categories as containers, we consequently imagine all categories to be inherently closed, with fixed, stable boundaries between them. Yet, intellectually, we know that these boundaries are almost always fluid and permeable to illustrate this point, Wittgenstein uses the example of the game we all know what a game is and what is not a game, which makes it seem to be a closed category However, defining a game precisely is difficult. Is a game played on a board? Do you have to keep score? Is it played between two people? Are there teams? What about something like solitaire? although in our minds we think of the category ‘game’ as a container with rigid boundaries that allow us to mentally place some things into the container and to place others on the outside, when you try to define it the category’s boundaries turn out to be quite open. he paradox of categories, is that when we are trying to think of the boundaries between categories as open and porous – which, intellectually, we know they are – we tend cognitively to understand categories as closed and bounded containers categories appear to be necessary in order to understand the world around us. On the other hand, these same categories, as Foucault and others have demonstrated, are the instruments through which order is established and power exercised categories limit and control experiences I would propose that geography should re-emphasize its connection with these topics through an analysis of the inchoate process of bounding that delimits the categories that shape daily life and academic work.\nCognitive science proves that categorization via the creation of borders is the root of us-them distinctions\nJones 8 (Reese, Associate Professor and Chair of Graduate Studies Department of Geography University of Hawai‘i at Manoa, 13 May 2008, “Categories, borders and boundaries” Progress in Human Geography)", "metadata": {"topic": "Kritiks", "citation": "Jones 8 (Reese, Associate Professor and Chair of Graduate Studies Department of Geography University of Hawai‘i at Manoa, 13 May 2008, “Categories, borders and boundaries” Progress in Human Geography)", "camp": "Texas (UTNIF)", "tag": "Kritiks", "year": "2013", "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:10Z"}

Elsewhere, Agamben links the move to render the system inoperative with notions of ‘profanation’, meaning to violate or transgress, and play Agamben seeks to demonstrate the profanatory potential in play as a means of creating a new use of something by deactivating an old one.

Borders can connect as well as divide, not just proximate entities, but globally. “cross-border interactions are more likely to occur when the ‘other side’ is easily accessible, in contrast to when people live farther away from the border”\nModern borders are engines of connectivity that allow for engagement with the other\nRumford 11, Chris Rumford, Department of Politics and International Relations, Royal Holloway, University of London, “Seeing like a border” Political Geography 30 (2011) pages 61-69", "metadata": {"topic": "Kritiks", "citation": "Rumford 11, Chris Rumford, Department of Politics and International Relations, Royal Holloway, University of London, “Seeing like a border” Political Geography 30 (2011) pages 61-69", "camp": "Texas (UTNIF)", "tag": "Kritiks", "year": "2013", "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:10Z"}

To prepare new partnerships it is important to have in mind the three processes already reviewed: prevailing global trends, US government policies and the status of the US economy, and priorities that Latin American governments are ready to carry out. Immigration will continue to be necessary for the United States to sustain its growth. Negative aspects of immigration tend to grab the spotlight, but the fact remains that Latin American immigrants make a major contribution to the US economy. This would make the United States the only industrialized country to have population growth through 2030 –the rest of the countries should cooperate and coordinate with one another more effectively to have some influence on global political and economic trends But smaller Latin American countries must seek closer cooperation and coordination to enhance their influence.Each will take the initiative and seek mutually beneficial arrangements with the United States. As a start, three areas are worth pursuing: democracy strengthening; energy and climate change; and education, science, and technology. Democracy Strengthening a collaboration could bolster the fight against organized crime, improve citizen security, and strengthen democratic institutions. South American nations should get more involved in providing assistance to Haiti. c) The region should also offer support to help facilitate a transition to democracy in Cuba. the ineffective US embargo continues with no end in sight. Energy and Climate Chang There are opportunities for collaboration in developing renewable energy sources, especially solar, and assisting with nuclear plant safety and ethanol, cleaner coal, and natural gas research. b) Partnership with the United States could also help Latin America reduce CO2 emissions, protect tropical and temperate forests, and safeguard glaciers and water resources. Latin America abounds in natural resources and must take measures to protect them. c) Climate change and increasing concentration of the population will intensify the impact of natural disasters. Emergency preparedness requires effective institutions, Education, Science, and Technology Education, science, and technology help increase productivity and drive growth.Collaboration in these areas could focus on goods and services, with an emphasis on the use of information and communications technology.Latin American countries should propose innovative initiatives and explore areas of potential agreement, 16 technology applications that will change living conditions in this decade and notes that some Latin American countries will be able to adopt them if they carry out certain policies and make a sustained effort the United States should move to eliminate barriers and open its market to Latin American products, especially foods. If WTO talks remain deadlocked, free trade agreements between the United States and Latin America should be expande . A more open global economy helps small and medium-sized countries whose development depends on exporting goods and services with increasing value-added.

That’s longer than the 12 years it took to add the 6 billionth—the first time in human history that interval had grown. (The 2 billionth, 3 billionth, 4 billionth, and 5 billionth took 123, 33, 14, and 13 years, respectively.) In other words, the rate of global population growth has slowed. And it’s expected to keep slowing. Indeed, according to experts’ best estimates, the total population of Earth will stop growing within the lifespan of people alive today. And then it will fall. But population decline is a very familiar concept in the rest of the developed world, where fertility has long since fallen far below the 2.1 live births per woman required to maintain population equilibrium. In Germany, the birthrate has sunk to just 1.36, worse even than its low-fertility neighbors Spain (1.48) and Italy (1.4). American media have largely ignored the issue of population decline for the simple reason that it hasn’t happened here yet. Unlike Europe, the United States has long been the beneficiary of robust immigration. This has helped us not only by directly bolstering the number of people calling the United States home but also by propping up the birthrate, since immigrant women tend to produce far more children than the native-born do. But both those advantages look to diminish in years to come immigrant births fell from 102 per 1,000 women in 2007 to 87.8 per 1,000 in 2012. That helped bring the overall U.S. birthrate to a mere 64 per 1,000 women—not enough to sustain our current population. Moreover, the poor, highly fertile countries that once churned out immigrants by the boatload are now experiencing birthrate declines of their own Mexico’s fertility rate tumbled from 7.3 live births per woman to 2.4 This change in developing countries will affect not only the U.S. population, of course, but eventually the world’s. “in order for humanity to survive things like epidemics and wars and famine, birthrates had to be very high.” Eventually, thanks to technology, death rates started to fall in Europe and in North America, and the population size soared. In time, though, birthrates fell as well, and the population leveled out. The same pattern has repeated in countries around the world. Demographic transition, Sanderson says, “is a shift between two very different long-run states: from high death rates and high birthrates to low death rates and low birthrates.” Not only is the pattern well-documented, it’s well under way: Already, more than half the world’s population is reproducing at below the replacement rate. the long-dreaded resource shortage may turn out not to be a problem at all the demographic shift toward more retirees and fewer workers could throw the rest of the world into the kind of interminable economic And in the long term—on the order of centuries—we could be looking at the literal extinction of humanity. That might sound like an outrageous claim, but it comes down to simple math. According to a 2008 IIASA report, if the world stabilizes at a total fertility rate of 1.5—where Europe is today—then by 2200 the global population will fall to half of what it is today. By 2300, it’ll barely scratch 1 billion Europe’s population is falling faster than was previously anticipated, while Africa’s birthrate is declining more slowly—but the overall outlook is the same.) Extend the trend line, and within a few dozen generations you’re talking about a global population small enough to fit in a nursing home focusing too single-mindedly on the problem of overpopulation could have disastrous consequences—see China’s one-child policy. demographic transition can be expressed in one word: education. One of the first things that countries do when they start to develop is educate their young people, including girls. That dramatically improves the size and quality of the workforce. But it also introduces an opportunity cost for having babies. “Women with more schooling tend to have fewer children, As much as we adore our little guys, they’re a lot of work and frighteningly expensive. Most of our friends have just one or two kids, too, and like us they regard the prospect of having three or four kids the way most people look at ultramarathoning or transoceanic sailing—admirable pursuits, but only for the very committed. That attitude could do for Homo sapiens what that giant asteroid did for the dinosaurs. If humanity is going to sustain itself, then the number of couples deciding to have three or four kids will consistently have to exceed the number opting to raise one or zero.\nPopulation will decline – underpopulation leads to extinction\nWise 13 - New York-based magazine writer and author of Extreme Fear: The Science of Your Mind in Danger.

This is leads to famine and conflict in different areas around the world. Clearly we have never understood desertification,” he added, “which now threatens us globally. This is all wrong, the way Savory sees it. True, sustainable solutions are found by looking at whole systems, holistically, unconcerned with time, and focused on the restoration of natural balances. . A natural source for the solution. Patience. These are the tools Allan Savory works with now. Cows to the Rescue So the failure of earlier attempts combined with his estimation that two-thirds of Earth is now desertifying inspired Savory to search for a new approach to protecting and restoring grasslands. And there were areas of the U.S. where cattle had been removed for decades, but the grasslands were still desertifying. Allan Savory says the key to restoring grasslands is to manage livestock to mimic the role once played by vast migrating herds. “The only option left,” according to Savory, is “to use livestock on the move to mimic the ancient herds.” Keeping cattle more densely packed on smaller plots of land and moving them frequently keeps them from exhausting the supply of living plants, turns scattered droppings into a full blanket of high-quality fertilizer, and keeps the repeated trod of untold tons from packing down the dirt. He’s done it for decades, and the results (seen in the video above) are impressive. Holistic grazing” keeps more plants alive, adds nutrients to the soil, and creates soil conditions that hold and use water instead of letting it evaporate or run off. The amount of plant life lost through desertification over decades has severely compromised Earth’s ability to take carbon dioxide out of the air. Just as we have increased the amount we’re putting into the atmosphere, we’re reducing the amount we take out. There is a remarkable upside to this however. With all of the difficulties of maintaining a productive economy while reducing our carbon output, and mitigating the effects of a warming climate if we can implement holistic grazing on half of the Earth’s grasslands, according to Allan, “we can take us back to pre-industrial [CO2] levels… and feed people .” It would be wrong to think of changing the way we herd cattle as a silver buller that will solve all of Earth and humanity’s challenges, but as a key step in promoting the kind of long-term, holistic view that Allan Savory has taken, it could go a long way towards repairing the land and our relationship to it.\nText: The United States Government should force implementation of holistic grazing throughout the United States\nHowley 13 – Andrew Howley is a member of the National Geographic Mission Programs team, working to share the stories of NG explorers, he cites Allan Savory a Zimbabwean biologist, farmer, soldier, exile, environmentalist, and winner of the 2003 Banksia International Award and the 2010 Buckminster Fuller Challenge, (Andrew, “How Cows Could Repair the World: Allan Savory at TED”, National Geograzphic, March 6, 2013, http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/06/how-cows-could-repair-the-world-allan-savory-at-ted/)//sawyer", "metadata": {"topic": "Case Negatives", "citation": "Howley 13 – Andrew Howley is a member of the National Geographic Mission Programs team, working to share the stories of NG explorers, he cites Allan Savory a Zimbabwean biologist, farmer, soldier, exile, environmentalist, and winner of the 2003 Banksia International Award and the 2010 Buckminster Fuller Challenge, (Andrew, “How Cows Could Repair the World: Allan Savory at TED”, National Geograzphic, March 6, 2013, http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/06/how-cows-could-repair-the-world-allan-savory-at-ted/)//sawyer", "camp": "Michigan (7-week)", "tag": "Case Negatives", "year": "2013", "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:10Z"}

Regulation would be easier to manage and revenue could be used in education campaigns to prevent hard drug use and in the rehabilitation of addicts.

It is a profoundly anti-democratic procedure because it shuts down debate. But from start to end, TPP has been thoroughly anti-democratic. On the first day of the Singapore talks a broad range of civil society organizations issued an open letter to Congress calling for greater transparency in the proceedings. The agreement is being hammered out in secret discussions among trade ministers. Even Senators have been denied a look at its draft provisions. an agreement that actually formalizes the priority of corporate power over government Wallach says the rest of the draft “include[s] new rights for the big pharmaceutical companies to expand, to raise medical prices, expand monopoly patents, limits on Internet freedom, penalties for inadvertent noncommercial copying, sending something to a friend. There are limits on domestic financial stability regulations. There are limits on imported food safety standards and product standards. There are limits on how we can regulate energy towards a more green future – all of these things are what they call ‘Behind the Borders’ agenda. And the operating clause of TPP is: ‘Each country shall ensure the conformity of its domestic laws, regulations and administrative procedures with these agreements.’” Free trade is about more than trade. It is about favoring corporations over the democratic rights of citizens and the sovereignty of nations What is being created is a global governance order in which corporation are the citizens, not flesh and blood humans like you and me. With free trade, corporations are making an end run around democracy. TPP is the latest offensive in a global class war For nearly 40 years now, since the mid 1970s, corporations have been rolling back the popular gains of the New Deal era and the 1960s. Democracy has been the target of a class war to restore the class power of capital. And there has been weak resistance, at best, by the popular classes. But the stakes have become increasingly clear to more and more. Indeed, on the issue of free trade, there is now a broad public sentiment against this aspect of the corporate offensive. The US has promoted free trade for much the same reason Great Britain promoted it in the 19th century, viz. the economically strongest country in the world benefits from free trade. It is the weaker countries that seek tariff protection for their infant industries, protection from competition with cheaper and higher quality imports. That protection is what enabled the US to industrialize in the last half of the 19th century. But then when the US became economically strong enough to compete regionally and eventually globally, it became an advocate of free trade and demanded that others abandon protectionism. The justification for free trade rests on the theory of comparative advantage. This is the view that if countries trade free of government impediments, the market will tend to direct each to export that which they can produce most efficiently and import what can be produced more efficiently and thus more cheaply elsewhere. The invisible hand of the market will guide each to specialize in producing what they have a comparative advantage in. Thus a rational production and trading system will emerge that maximizes efficiency. NAFTA were sold to the US public by appealing to consumer’s interest in having access to cheaper goods imported from Mexico Organized labor opposed NAFTA, fearing it would pit US workers in competition with low wage Mexican workers. Independent presidential candidate Ross Perot warned of “a giant sucking sound” as jobs would be off-shored to Mexico. Perot proved to be correct as US companies shifted production to low wage Mexico – until even lower wage Chinese workers were brought into play when China joined WTO. But Clinton was also right as cheaper consumer goods from abroad filled the shelves of Wal-Mart with bargains welcomed by US workers who found their wages reduced. Free trade proved to be a mixed blessing. One important point about free trade that is often overlooked It assures the free movement of capital, as corporations are freed to invest abroad. The mobility of investment capital is of utmost importance, with profound economic consequences and consequences for democracy. large corporations have increasingly moved abroad. They sought not just new outlets to sell their commodities, but low wage workforces that would decrease their production costs and thus boost their profits. The assembly lines of US industry were disaggregated and disbursed across the globe. , they overcome the limitations of the fixed assembly lines of the Fordist era in that they no longer have to rely on a fixed labor force that can organize itself to effectively claim a share of the surplus they create. flexibility to seek out the lowest wage workforce and friendliest business environment available anywhere in the world Technicians can work at points distant from the processes of production to which they address themselves. And the entire process can be coordinated by management located anywhere on the globe. The limitations of space and time have been overcome by digital communications and cheap energy for transporting goods to their ultimate consumers. capital must be able to flow freely across national borders and products have to be able to move with minimum friction across those borders, unhampered by tariffs or quotas or non-uniform standards. In other words, there must be free trade for transnational capital to optimize accumulation.# corporations also need legal protection of their investments. They need protection from expropriation of their assets, laws and governments that can ensure their property is secure. This involves more than just protection from expropriation, as happens with revolutions. It also involves protection from governmental actions that might reduce the value of their property or potential profits by environmental and health regulations, labor laws or other such measures even though they might be for the public good. What in US law is called “regulatory takings” are seen as tantamount to expropriation. foreign corporation the recourse to sue. The suit is not adjudicated in a national court, but by a transnational body of experts operating in secret. States are expected to enforce its decisions on their own nation’s taxpayers and consumers. This favors investor rights (i.e. the interests of transnational corporations) over the democratic rights of a nation.\nTPP and free trade place corporations above human beings\nDuRand 13 - Cliff DuRand is a Research Associate at the Center for Global Justice and a contributor to the CIP Americas Program www.cipamericas.org.

America is “committing economic suicide” by making it too hard for ambitious foreigners to enter the United States and unleash their drive and ingenuity There are 8,800 immigrant-owned small businesses in Boston, he said, producing nearly $3.7 billion in annual sales and employing more than 18,000 people. New Americans have swelled Boston’s population to 625,000, its healthiest level since 1970 — healthy because “more people mean more talent, more ideas, and more innovation.” They also mean more revenue: Boston’s immigrants spend $4 billion per year, generating $1.3 billion in state and federal taxes. “An immigrant is more likely to start a small business than a non-immigrant,” said Murdoch, whose career exemplifies the phenomenon It’s the immigrants.” Ambitious foreigners “want to dream the American dream,” and it’s in America’s national interest to help them do so. There is an abundance of empirical evidence that immigration is a tremendous economic driver. More than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children, and immigrants are now more than twice as likely as US natives to start a business. Though the foreign-born account for less than 13 percent of the US population, they created 28 percent of all new American businesses in 2011. if only more Americans understood what remarkable job-creators immigrants tend to be, fewer politicians would feel the need to play to anti-immigrant xenophobia. “People don’t come here to put their feet up and collect welfare,” Bloomberg said. “They come here to work. If there are no jobs, they don’t come.” You’d never know it from the clamor over illegal immigration but illegal border crossings have sharply declined. What hasn’t declined is the hunger of strivers and dreamers the world over — talented entrepreneurs eager to bring their gifts here and make a success of themselves Fixing that system must become a priority — for left, right, and center alike.\nImmigration reform is key to the economy\nJacoby 12 (Jeff, Columnist for The Globe and JB from Boston University, Immigration reform key to economic revival.

This optimism maybe unjustified but it is a different state of from frustrated misery his definition of happiness as the absence of suffering run counter to direct experience. We are indeed exhilarated by relief but in the enjoyment of great art, or love, or friendship, there is something more These things involve us in a relationship with something or someone outside ourselves, a gratified extension of ourselves which is self-enhancing and in that sense positive. Something of the sort is true of physical pleasures. When confronted with good food and drink we do not push them aside the moment our hunger and thirst are assuaged, but carry on eating and drinking for the sheer enjoyment this is normal A compulsive smoker rarely feels 'My God, I am enjoying this cigarette! he is only subliminally aware of the fact. It is when he is not smoking that smoking fills his consciousness But the fact is that, in addition to this, there are times after a good meal or with the first cigarette of the day – when the compulsive smoker does feel 'My good, I am enjoying this cigarette!'

ALBA is primarily financed by Chávez’s subsidized oil exports, with this relationship being too close to be coincidental. Chávez has engineered ALBA so that he can ultimately sell more oil. Even though Venezuela episodically has threatened to cut off its oil exports to the U.S., these threats will never become a reality; Venezuela would never stop selling oil to the U.S. because these purchases add up to approximately 60% of Venezuela’s total oil exports.

For Closer to home, however, matters look different. For Nature offers us a multitude of ecosystem services, which include maintaining a genetic library, preserving and regenerating soil, fixing nitrogen and carbon, recycling nutrients, controlling floods, filtering pollutants, assimilating waste, pollinating crops, operating the hydrological cycle, and maintaining the gaseous composition of the atmosphere. A number of these services filter into a global context And the reason for that is that natural capital is frequently mobile. At the broadest level soil, water, and the atmosphere (which are capital assets themselves) are media that enable capital assets to connect among themselves and flourish, meaning that a disturbance to any one asset can be expected to reverberate on many others at distances away, sometimes at far distances. Under current practice though the consequences of the connectedness of natural capital can easily go unnoted in economic transactions. 8 It can then be that those who destroy mangroves in order to create shrimp farms, or cut down forests in the uplands of watersheds to export timber, are not required to compensate fishermen dependent on the mangroves, or farmers and fishermen in the lowlands whose fields and fisheries are protected by the upland forests.\nEnvironmental Regulation under Economic Expansion is impossible- empirics prove\nMcCarty 4 (Professor James McCarthy earned a B.A. in English and Environmental Studies from Dartmouth College and an M.A. and Ph.D. in Geography from the University of California, Berkeley.

Growing shortages of water and less productive land to yield crops will further hinder the world’s future food production. “The world has ignored the ominous constellation of factors that now make feeding humanity sustainably our most pressing task – even in times of economic and climatic crisis,” writes Professor Cribb.

Debates also allow students to develop and exercise skills that may translate to political activities, such as testifying before legislative committees. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, debates may help to stimulate critical thinking by shaking students free from established opinions and helping them to appreciate the complexities involved in policy dilemmas. critical thinkers acknowledge the imperative to argue from opposing points of view and to seek to identify weakness and limitations in one's own position. Critical thinkers are aware that there are many legitimate points of view, each of which (when thought through) may yield some level of insight. (p. 126) John Dewey, the philosopher and educational reformer, suggested that the initial advance in the development of reflective thought occurs in the transition from holding fixed, static ideas to an attitude of doubt and questioning engendered by exposure to alternative views in social discourse Doubt, confusion, and conflict resulting from discussion of diverse perspectives \"force comparison, selection, and reformulation of ideas and meanings\" learning requires openness to divergent ideas in combination with the ability to synthesize disparate views into a purposeful resolution (Kolb, 1984; Perry, 1970). On the one hand, clinging to the certainty of one's beliefs risks dogmatism, rigidity, and the inability to learn from new experiences involving students in substantive debates challenges them to learn and grow in the fashion described by Dewey and Kolb. Participation in a debate stimulates clarification and critical evaluation of the evidence, logic, and values underlying one's own policy position. In addition, to debate effectively students must understand and accurately evaluate the opposing perspective. The ensuing tension between two distinct but legitimate views is designed to yield a reevaluation and reconstruction of knowledge and beliefs pertaining to the issue.\nOur framework forces debates on both sides of a social issue which stimulates critical thinking and helps students understand the complexities of policy dilemmas – this is critical to check dogmatism\nKeller, University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration Professor, et. al, 01 – [Asst. professor School of Social Service Administration U. of Chicago (Thomas E., James K., and Tracly K., Asst. professor School of Social Service Administration U. of Chicago, professor of Social Work, and doctoral student School of Social Work, 2001 (“Student debates in policy courses: promoting policy practice skills and knowledge through active learning,” Journal of Social Work Education, Spr/Summer 2001, EBSCOhost, Accessed on July 5, 2013)][SP]", "metadata": {"topic": "Kritik Answers", "citation": "Keller, University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration Professor, et. al, 01 – [Asst. professor School of Social Service Administration U. of Chicago (Thomas E., James K., and Tracly K., Asst. professor School of Social Service Administration U. of Chicago, professor of Social Work, and doctoral student School of Social Work, 2001 (“Student debates in policy courses: promoting policy practice skills and knowledge through active learning,” Journal of Social Work Education, Spr/Summer 2001, EBSCOhost, Accessed on July 5, 2013)][SP]", "camp": "Gonzaga (GDI)", "tag": "Kritik Answers", "year": "2013", "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:10Z"}

Greater shale gas production in the United States, and eventually Europe, will also make it more difficult for Iran to profit from exporting natural gas. Since Iran is currently hampered by Western sanctions against investment in its energy sector, This reality may give the United States and its allies more leverage over Iran for a longer period of time, helping to shape outcomes in the Middle East more positive for U.S. and allied interests.¶ Iran is more likely to become a much larger exporter in the case in which no new shale is developed primarily because of greater LNG demand from the United States. shale gas plays an instrumental role in delaying the opening for Iran to sell its natural gas, thwarting its ability in the near term to use natural gas exports as a means to develop bilateral relations with major gas consuming countries and limiting its opportunity to use energy diplomacy to strengthen its regional position29 or buttress its pursuit of nuclear weapons. lower requirements for Iranian natural gas could make it easier for the United States to achieve buy-in for continued economic sanctions against Iran. Lower interest in Iranian gas reduces the chances that Iran can use its energy resources to drive a wedge in the international coalition against it. By delaying the need for Iranian gas the United States buys time to find a better solution to the Iranian nuclear problem and leaves open the possibility that political change will take place in Iran the long delay in the commerciality of Iranian gas means that Tehran will have trouble getting Asian pipelines to India or Pakistan off the ground with mutually acceptable terms reducing a potential source of tension between the United States and India.30\nUS gas supply curbs Iranian gas leverage – contributes to international cooperation to prevent a nuclear Iran\nMedlock et al. 11 - Dr. Kenneth B.
