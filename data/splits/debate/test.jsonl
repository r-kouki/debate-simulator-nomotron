If colonialism takes power in the name of history, it repeatedly exercises its authority through the figures of farce. For the epic intention of the civilizing mission, \"human and not wholly human\" mimicry emerges as one of the most elusive and effective strategies of colonial power and knowledge. the demand for identity, stasis-and the counter-pressure of the diachrony of history-change, difference - mimicry represents an ironic compromise. colonial mimicry is the desire for a reformed, recognizable Other, as a subject of a differencteh at is almost thes ame, but not quite. Which is to say, that the discourse of mimicry is constructed around an ambivalence; in order to be effective, mimicry must continually produce its slippage, its excess, its difference. The authority of that mode of colonial discourse that I have called mimicry is therefore stricken by an indeterminacy: mimicry emerges as the representation of a difference that is itself a process of disavowal. Mimicry is, thus, the sign of a double articulation; a complex strategy of reform, regulation, and discipline, which \"appropriates\" the Other as it visualizes power. Mimicry is also the sign of the inappropriate, however, a difference or recalcitrance which coheres the dominant strategic function of colonial power, intensifies surveillance, and poses an immanent threat to both \"normalized\" knowledges and disciplinary powers. The effect of mimicry on the authority of colonial discourse is profound and disturbing. For in \"normalizing\" the colonial state or subject, the dream of post-Enlightenment civility alienates its own language of liberty and produces another knowledge of its norms. It is from this area between mimicry and mockery, where the reforming, civilizing mission is threatened by the displacing gaze of its disciplinary double, It is as if the very emergence of the \"colonial\" is dependent for its representation upon some strategic limitation or prohibition within the authoritative discourse itself. The success of colonial appropriation depends on a proliferation of inappropriate objects that ensure its strategic failure, so that mimicry is at once resemblance and menace.\nMimicry may be used as a tool to oppress the postcolonial subject, or a method to explode the postcolonial power matrix.\nBhaba 1984 (Homi K, Director of the Humanities Center at Harvard, 1984, \"Of Mimicry and Man: The Ambivalence of Colonial Discourse” http://www.jstor.org/stable/778467)(pg. 127)", "metadata": {"topic": "Kritiks", "citation": "Bhaba 1984 (Homi K, Director of the Humanities Center at Harvard, 1984, \"Of Mimicry and Man: The Ambivalence of Colonial Discourse” http://www.jstor.org/stable/778467)(pg. 127)", "camp": "Gonzaga (GDI)", "tag": "Kritiks", "year": "2013", "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:10Z"}

Latin America-specific research will provide policymakers with evidence necessary to underpin a debate which seems to be nurtured more by anxiety than rigorous knowledge. it is useful to refer to policy debates and future research It is crucial to invest in the generation of data and research techniques, to adapt the research agenda to the specificity of Latin America Trade openness, inequality and poverty are wide multidimensional concepts. Measuring and attributing causal relations among these variables without carefully qualifying the specific dimensions explored or the particular transmission mechanisms at play may be misleading. Despite the impossibility to unambiguously assert that trade openness is conducive to poverty reduction, the preponderance of evidence supports this conclusion it is extremely arduous to find evidence that supports the notion that trade protection is good for the poor. The question is therefore how to make trade and growth more pro-poor and not how to devise improbable alternatives to trade integration aiming at improving the livelihood of the poor deductive generalisations of the neoclassical trade theory and global cross-country empirical studies may be of little help in understanding the trade and poverty nexus in the region Trade liberalisation may be associated with inequality. But case studies present contrasting indications the specific effects of trade liberalisation are small or indirect. Skill-biased technical change, often directly related with the increase of foreign direct investment or with capital account liberalisation, seems to have a stronger explanatory power than trade liberalisation the case of Brazil, where trade liberalisation seems to have contributed to the reduction of wage inequality, is illustrative empirical analysis reveals Trade integration seems to be good for the poor Generalisations should be taken with a great deal of caution predicting effects is dependent on data and specification of the simulation It is hard to overstate the importance of policymaking in this area\nSpecific pragmatic reforms are key in Latin America\nGiordano and Li 12 [November 2012, Paolo, PhD in Economics from the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris, Lead Economist at the Integratoin and Trade Sector of the IADB, and Kun, Research Fellow at IADB, “An Updated Assessment of the Trade and Poverty Nexus in Latin America,” pages 375-377, http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=67029]", "metadata": {"topic": "Case Negatives", "citation": "Giordano and Li 12 [November 2012, Paolo, PhD in Economics from the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris, Lead Economist at the Integratoin and Trade Sector of the IADB, and Kun, Research Fellow at IADB, “An Updated Assessment of the Trade and Poverty Nexus in Latin America,” pages 375-377, http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=67029]", "camp": "Northwestern (NHSI)", "tag": "Case Negatives", "year": "2013", "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:10Z"}

This silencing of the non-Western other is customarily combined with  representations that legitimize the power to penetrate and to re-order.  The posited superiorities of Western ‘progress’, ‘modernization’,  ‘democracy’, ‘development’ and ‘civilization’ are deployed to justify a  project of enduring invasiveness. The non-Western society is shorn of the  legitimate symbols of independent identity and authority, and its representation  tends to be frozen around the negative attributes of lack,  backwardness, inertia and violence It becomes a space ready to be  penetrated, worked over, restructured and transformed. This is a process  that is seen as being beneficial to the re-ordered society, so that resistance,  especially in its militant form, is envisaged as being deviant and  irrational. while power and knowledge are combined together, they  cannot be adequately grasped if abstracted from the gravity of imperial  encounters and the geopolitical history of West/non-West relations The desire to intervene, to possess, to take hold of another  society, even if only temporarily, flows from that deeply rooted sense of  superiority and mission.  ‘Manifest  Destiny’ or ‘benevolent assimilation’ were predicated on a belief in the  ostensible superiority of the Western and more specifically American way  of life. it was a  vision that was also embedded in a hierarchical perspective on peoples,  races and cultures, whereby the white/black binary division was seen as a  crucial marker of value and significance race went together with notions of destiny  and mission, as exemplified in the US–Mexico War, the colonization of  the Philippines and the creation of semi-protectorates such as Cuba at the  beginning of the twentieth century the desire to intervene was  also linked to protecting the Americas from the insecurity of political  disorder, and the tenets of civilization were closely associated with the  stipulated need to preserve socio-economic order and stability throughout  the American hemisphere.  The desire to intervene can also be traced modernization ideas were formulated with a view to diffuse  Western capital, technology, and social and political values to societies  that were judged to be traditional and in need of modern transformation.   the desire to project modernization  was also tied to a fear of the perceived vulnerability of Third World  societies to the ‘contagion of communism’ intervention had a  double motive, and while the perceived threat from communism came to  a close in 1989, the desire to modernize and re-order the other has  continued into the post-Cold War period.   the neo-liberal doctrine of development  can be distinguished from modernization theory in its greater  prioritization of the private sector and of the commodification of social  and economic life, it shares with modernization a privileging of a certain  view of the Western experience in matters not only economic Its desire to  intervene was initially anchored in a perception of an economic malaise,  of a debt crisis in the Third World that called for the cure of structural  adjustment, deregulation and privatization The ‘money doctors’ of the  international financial institutions have written a series of prescriptions  that amount to much more than a case of economic intervention, and their  will and capacity, as well as underlying desire, have been systematically  extended to cover a broad social, economic and political terrain, stretching  from structural adjustment through good governance to social capital with will its focusing requires a greater degree of discursive  order states provide focal points for  the will to intervene as we have seen in the case of the  United States, such a will has been allied to a multiple capacity to  intervene. The state provides the will and also coordinates the capacity  to intervene The will to intervene as a  crystallization of desire can only be deployed with effect when the  capacities to intervene are in place.  Will and capacity together provide a force, but their power is secured  as hegemonic power through the deployment of a discourse of justification In the context of the imperiality of US geopolitics, the will to power has  utilized a connected array of ideas and concepts to ground its projection it  also incorporated notions of ‘civilization’ and ‘order’ that the societies of  the Latin South were encouraged to embrace.

Feldman looks to bodily, spatial, and violent practices as configuring a unified language of material signification, compelling him to ‘treat the political subject, partic- ularly the body, as the locus of manifold material practices.’ . Violence is bound up within the production of social space and because, by virtue of spatiality, social space and somatic place continually predicate each other, the recognition of violence having a direct bearing on those bodies implies a geography of violence. individuals are at once both the vehicles of violence and its points of application. In the end, because the body is where all violence finds its influence be it direct and thus obvious to the entangled actors, or structural and thus temporally and spatially diffused before reaching its final destination at and upon the embodied geographies of human beings place is the site where violence is most visible and easily discerned So while violence bites down on our lived experiences by affixing itself to our everyday geographies and by colonizing our bodies, violence itself, much like culture, is by no means restricted to place, nor is place static. Thus, the place-based dynamics of violence that seemingly make it possible to conceive a ‘culture of violence’ actually render this notion untenable precisely because of place’s relationality and proteanism. In the face of such perme- ability an enculturation of violence is certainly conceivable. All forms of violence are not produced by the frenzied depravity of savage or pathological minds, but are instead cultural performances whose poetics derive from the sociocultural histories and relational geographies of the locale Yet the grounds on which some insist on affixing and bounding violence so firmly to particular places in articulating a ‘culture of violence’ argument are inherently unstable\nSpatial differences and borders are the root cause of all violence—they create spheres of power and domination\nSpringer 2011 [Simon, Department of Geography, University of Otago. “Violence sits in places?

Schmitt conceived a figure of the enemy – a threatening Other – that is constitutive of the state as 'the specific entity of a people'.8 Without it society is not political and a people cannot be said to exist such a conception of the political has a tendency to surround the entirety of political life with an aura of emergency and threat to one's very existence. Problems such as terrorism, flows of asylum seekers or weapons of mass destruction, are thus easily magnified into ones that must be viewed through the prisms of identity, existential antagonism and combat. While Schmitt claimed to be opposed to militarism (like many realists he stated that the political was only existent 'when a fighting collectivity of people confronts a similar collectivity'. Hence the potential for war was an existential condition: the entire life of a human being is a struggle and every human being is symbolically a combatant Bush went out of his way to defend his administration's conceptualisation of the response to terrorism as 'war' and the use of extraordinary legal powers and unilateral military force to meet the threat: the Executive Order that authorised the 'indefinite detention' and trial by 'military commissions' of the 'battlefield detainees' held in camps at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. As if sprung whole from Schmitt's theory, the Order stated that: An important detail about this extraordinary measure was that it only applied to non-citizens of the United States; citizens suspected of terrorism must be prosecuted under US criminal codes. Such orders invoke what Schmitt called the 'state of exception' wherein the existing legal order is suspended and 'unlimited authority' seized by the sovereign to meet a `danger to the existence of the state'. 'Sovereign is he who decides on the exception.' What is especially distinctive is not only the idealistic alignment of extra-judicial powers of life and death with sovereignty, freed from the dominance of the constitution and the rule of law, but the enactment of an uncertain threshold between law and the human in which the human can disappear as a matter of executive power and whim 'in the interest of the state, public safety and order'.1 Butler suggests that we are witnessing the emergence of 'normative conceptions of the human that produce, through an exclusionary process, a host of \"unliveable lives\" whose legal and political status is suspended'; lives 'viewed and judged so that they are less than human, or as having departed from the recognisable human community'.17 Agamben has done most to describe and denounce the violent and impoverished conceptualisation of life implicit in such a politics. He saw in the convergence of a Schmittian theory of sovereignty and biopolitics' a diabolical system of political and administrative power that reduced human existence to 'bare life' that 'may be killed and yet not sacrificed' – He sees such a simultaneously exceptional and biopolitical power at work in `the Camp', which took on its most horrific form in the Holocaust but is also in operation at the US prisons in Cuba and Abu Ghraib The camp is 'the biopolitical paradigm of the modern' and the state of exception is becoming normalised and universalised Agamben thus issues a profound warning for anyone concerned with interrogating modern conceptions of security – which, after all, posit the sovereign nation-state as the collective to be secured and abrogate to government powers to protect the 'life' of this collective. Yet in the age of biopolitics this power [to decide which life can be killed] becomes emancipated from the state of exception and transformed into the power to decide the point at which life ceases to be politically relevant. When life becomes the supreme political value, not only is the problem of life's nonvalue thereby posed as Schmitt suggests, but further, it is as if the ultimate ground of sovereign power were at stake in this decision. In modern biopolitics, sovereign is he who decides on the value or nonvalue of life as such 'every decisive political event were double-sided: the spaces, the liberties, and the rights won by individuals in their conflicts with central powers always simultaneously prepared a tacit but increasing inscription of individuals' lives within the state order, thus offering a new more dreadful foundation for the sovereign power from which they wanted to free themselves.'22 In this light, the 'active defense of the American people' comes to sound sinister indeed, for Americans and their Others alike.\nSchmitt’s conception of the political as coterminous with the nation-state combines with biopolitics in a way that allows the sovereign to decide on whose lives are worth saving and whose should be sacrificed.

In the EU the borderland has constituted the place for the emergence of transboundary border regions, where social, economic and cultural activities have come together across the border. This has been encouraged by the EU as a means of breaking down the tradi- tional barriers of national suspicion between the peoples on each side of the border, creat- ing the conditions for the eventual opening or removal of the border altogether. In many cases, the borderlands take on the charac- teristics of transition regions, enabling a gradual movement from one cultural norm to another, as contrasted with the rigid line understanding of the border as a distinct cut-off point. the person in transit from one place or group to another undergoes a process of acclimatization and acculturation as he/she moves through the zone of transition, so that the shock of meeting the ‘other’ is not as great as he/she feared Seemingly very different presentations, the two papers were surpris- ingly similar in their use – conscious and unconscious – of notions of border. In partic- ular, they both focused on the way that new spaces are created and the way in which groups working or operating within these ‘spaces of transition’ negotiate their way through and across the new borders and lines which have been created at the very heart of these new spaces.\nBorderlands are utilized as \"transition zones\" for the acclimatization of one culture into another.

So to identify America's \"foreign oil dependency\" as a source of vulnerability and weakness is just too neat and easy. This identification wholly ignores the dependency of foreign oil producers on their consumers, above all on the world's largest single market -- the United States no oil exporter is ever in a position to alienate its customers. , a supply disruption would always seriously damp global demand. Even in the best of times, a prolonged price spike could easily tip the world into economic recession, prompt consumers to shake off their gasoline dependency, or accelerate a scientific drive to find alternative fuels dependency of foreign oil producers on their customers plays straight into America's strategic hands. Washington is conceivably in a position to hold producers to ransom by threatening to accelerate a drive to develop or implement alternative fuels Back in 1973 Middle East producers were in a position to impose an oil embargo on the Western world. But a generation later, technological advances, and the strength of public and scientific concern about global warming, have turned the tables. The United States has powerful political leverage over producers because it holds the key to future oil supply as well as market demand. The age of \"easy oil\" is over, and as fears grow that oil is becoming harder to get, so too will the dependency of producers on increasingly sophisticated Western technology and expertise. Such skills will be particularly important in two key areas of oil production. One is finding and extracting offshore deposits The other is prolonging the lifespan of declining wells through enhanced \"tertiary\" recovery. Because Western companies have a clear technological edge over their global competitors in these hugely demanding areas, Washington exerts some powerful political leverage over exporters, many of whom openly anticipate the moment when their production peaks before gradually starting to decline. Syria illustrates how this leverage can work : Output is now nearly half of the peak it reached in the mid-1990s, , and can barely sustain rapidly growing domestic demand fueled by a very high rate of population growth. With enough foreign investment Syrian oil could be much more productive and enduring, but Washington has sent foreign companies, as well as American firms, a tough message to steer well clear. It is not surprising, then, that the Damascus regime regards a rapprochement with the U.S. as a political lifeline and in recent months has shown signs of a new willingness to compromise. The same predicament confronted Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi, who first offered to surrender weapons of mass destruction during secret negotiations with U.S. officials in May 1999. Facing a deepening economic crisis that he could not resolve without increasing the production of his main export, oil, Col. Gadhafi was prepared to bow to Washington's demands Oil can also act as a peacemaker and source of stability because many conflicts, in almost every part of the world, can threaten a disruption of supply and instantly send crude prices spiraling. Despite the recent price falls, the market is still vulnerable to sudden supply shocks, and a sharp increase would massively affect the wider global economy. oil is such a vital commodity, for consumers, producers and intermediaries alike, that it represents a meeting point for all manner of different interests. Sometimes it offers an opportunity for competitors and rivals to resolve differences, as in March 1995, when Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani tried to break deadlock with Washington by offering a technically very demanding oil contract to Conoco. Today, the symbiotic energy requirements of Europe and Russia allows scope to improve mutual relations, Oil also gives consumers a chance to penalize, or tempt, international miscreants, just as U.S. sanctions are forcing the Tehran regime to reassess its cost-benefit analysis of building the bomb. What cannot go unchallenged is a facile equation between oil on the one hand, and war, bloodshed and, in America's particular case, strategic vulnerability on the other. For oil, fortunately, can often be our guardian.\nOil dependence is good – allows de-escalation of conflicts globally\nHoward 8 (Roger, freelance journalist specialising in defence and energy issues in the Middle East.

Today, negotiating countries are splayed across the globe like a constellation only a highly trained astronomer could recognize. In addition to the first five, the TPP now includes Australia, Malaysia, Peru, and Vietnam. Canada and Mexico recently joined the talks and Japan is vying to participate in the negotiations But the language of TPP promoters rings hollow for those who have tracked the progress of other trade agreements, like NAFTA. That Mexico will become more competitive in other markets, Pérez-Rocha pointed out there’s little concrete evidence that Mexican exports to Asia will increase as an outcome of the agreement. “Mexico has actually signed many Free Trade Agreements with other countries, and its dependency to the US market hasn’t changed a bit,” he told the Americas Program. the TPP has taken shape as a second generation of geographically-distributed multilateral negotiations after the collapse of the World Trade Organization ( .S. economic interests with some of the fastest-growing economies in the world; expand U.S. exports, which are critical to the creation and retention of jobs in the United States; and serve as a potential platform for economic integration across the Asia-Pacific region.” During the negotiations, concerns have been raised that the TPP will limit access to generic medications, impact Internet access, and affect local markets for textiles, shoes, milk, and grains in negotiating countries. The TPP] is a way to isolate China, it’s a way to do an end run around the WTO and to kind of pursue the US agenda, which was not getting very far with countries that are willing to participate One of the key areas of concern is with the investment protection segment of the TPP, which was leaked in June 2012 to the US rights group Public Citizen. The TPP would bring in an augmented version of NAFTA’s controversial Chapter 11, an investment protection agreement by which companies can sue governments for imposing health and environmental legislation, among other things, applied across all countries involved. The leaked text reveals a two-track legal system, with foreign firms empowered to skirt domestic courts and laws to directly sue TPP governments in foreign tribunals They can demand compensation for domestic financial, health, environmental, land use laws and other laws they claim undermine their new TPP privileges.” While the TPP has some similarities with the free trade agreement that Chile signed with the United States in 2004, but from what has come out through leaks of the negotiating text, the TPP has intellectual property standards that are much higher than [the US-Chile FTA], which in the Chilean case could imply changes to laws which protect innovation and internet users,” so this agreement doesn’t represent any economic or employment gains or [changes to] market access, instead it represents losses as we are required to implement stricter norms with regards to intellectual property, without any retribution.” They’re more in the area of deepening institutional reforms in sensitive sectors like intellectual property,” Alejandra Alayza, executive coordinator of the Peruvian Network for Globalization with Equity (redGE Perú), told the Americas Program from her office in Lima. The US proposal [regarding intellectual property] has been on the table for more than a year and a half, and regardless of the fact that the other countries have rejected the proposal, the US is insisting on raising the standards and they haven’t pulled their proposal, at the same time, they’re seeking to wrap up negotiations in the next few months,” Pharmaceutical drugs and the IP chapter in the TPP could also have an impact on the availability of generic drugs of other negotiating countries, including Canada, according to Trew, who says drug prices in Canada will likely rise if the TPP is passed. “Proposed by U.S. negotiators, the IP rules enhance patent and data protections for pharmaceutical companies, dismantle public health safeguards enshrined in international law, and obstruct price-lowering generic competition for medicines, The stakes are a little different in Mexico, which has an economy that is much more dependent on the US the TPP will deepen Mexico’s dependence, Mexico is much more dependent on the United States, more dependent to NAFTA, in general Mexican producers are very concerned that the privileges Mexico has with the United States will be diluted, that Asian companies will be able to come and assemble in Mexico and export to the United States, affecting very strongly Mexican producers noting that the Mexican textile and shoemaking sector have shown opposition to the pact For example textiles, they could import from Vietnam, to name a country, and they wouldn’t pay tariffs on the imports, and then they could produce clothes to export to the United States from here in Mexico, so basically that’s one of the gravest concerns of the textile associations.” Mexico’s milk, coffee and basic grains sectors could all be negatively impacted through the passage of the TPP. Canada’s dairy sector could also take a hit if the TPP is passed. Really its just another race to the bottom, but no one wants to get left out, no one wants their economy to be somehow damaged if they’re not part of the negotiations,” said Trew.\nThe TPP will empower corporate control – specifically in Mexico\nPaley 13 -Dawn Paley is a freelance journalist and independent researcher, (“Tremendous Pharmaceutical Profits or Totally Protected Plunder, 4/17/13, http://www.cipamericas.org/archives/9369)//sawyer", "metadata": {"topic": "Case Negatives", "citation": "Paley 13 -Dawn Paley is a freelance journalist and independent researcher, (“Tremendous Pharmaceutical Profits or Totally Protected Plunder, 4/17/13, http://www.cipamericas.org/archives/9369)//sawyer", "camp": "Michigan (7-week)", "tag": "Case Negatives", "year": "2013", "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:10Z"}

This growing threat of exchanging invaders between eastern Asia and North America was addressed at the 2004 Beijing Threats to Environment and Economy This special feature was motivated, in part, by the outcome of the symposium. China including microorganisms, plants, invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, ﬁsh, and mammals (Xu et al. 2006). Over 50% of these invasive species originated from North America e The total economic losses caused by invasive alien species to China were $14.45 billion in 2000 this feature, Williamson argues that looking for universal attributes and causes of invasions is not proﬁtable, because invasions can go through a series of stages and the important factors are often diﬀerent at each. Preventing invasions ultimately will be determined by policy makers. They suggest the adoption of a ‘clean list’ policy in which only approved species can be allowed to enter. As trade and transportation of species increases among the countries of North America and eastern Asia, we may have the opportunity to develop preemptive policy based on collaborative science between the regions rather than the retroactive responses once invasives have already established and spread. Again, explicit collaborative eﬀorts among scientists in diﬀerent continents, such as modeled in this feature, may allow much more rapid responses than in the past But clear evidence for such escape from such powerful top–down regulation is scarce and invasions appear to have other causes such as response to human disturbance, occupation of empty niches, or the possession of novel biochemical weapons Relative to North America, the ecological and economic impact of exotics in eastern Asia is lower but on the rise Therefore it is now feasible to make some meaningful comparisons in both research and invasives management between North America and eastern Asia. We hope that future collaborations among scientists in eastern Asia and North America, such as initiated in this special feature, will shed light on the nature of exotic invasions\nIncreased trade with the trans-pacific will cause an influx in invasive species killing biodiversity and the economy\nCallaway et al 6 – Ragan M.

These figures for job loss (which many would argue are a relatively insignificant price to pay for job increases in the industrial sector), however, do not factor in the exploding growth in Mexico's job-age population 1 million new workers are entering the job force each year, and will continue to enter at this rate until the year 2020 NAFTA was originally marketed to the skeptical (and xenophobic) United States precisely as a way of protecting a territorial border repeatedly figured as \"under siege\" by undocumented Mexican workers By most measures, illegal immigration to the United States continued to increase after NAFTA came into effect. Apprehensions along the U.S. southwestern border also continued to increase, from about 700,000 in 1994 to more than 1,300,000 at their peak in 2001 the number of Mexicans present in the United States without authorization rose from 2 million in 1990 to 4.8 million in 2000, increasing from 59.3 percent to 68.7 percent of the estimated total unauthorized population in the United States NAFTA as a success in terms of its limited goals, for all sorts of economic indicators are up in Mexico: FDI, GDP, job production in industry, volume of trade. Thus, free trade enthusiasts across the Americas point to such statistics as evidence of NAFTA's resounding success, which they interpret as not only bestowing economic well-being, but also ushering in Mexico's transition to an electoral democracy these figures also expose a fiction at the heart of NAFTA's legal regime with regard to territorial boundaries NAFTA was promulgated under the operative fiction that territorial borders could be porous to goods and capital but closed to those laborers whose impoverishment is often the result of NAFTA-style development economic indicators tell a story of displacement and diaspora three million new immigrants from Mexico have traveled to the United States, hey have faced deserts and militarized border patrols, coyotes and Mexican police, not to find jobs in the Southwest among established generations of Mexican immigrants, as in previous decades, but rather to settle new urban areas—as delivery boys and maids in English-speaking New York City—or to enter debt peonage—as isolated agricultural laborers in Durham, North Carolina, in Stamford, Connecticut, and on Long Island.

These findings are consistent across states as different as Oaxaca, Mexico and Chiapas The failures of the Zapatistas, resulted in an increasingly significant flow of migrants out of the state Sadly, these flows, which are in part caused by the absence of a serious political project to redistribute resources and spur development, probably also contribute over time to the absence of such a project\nThe Zapatistas fail – no economic program or model for reform – only state engagement solves inequality and neoliberalism\nLakin 9 ( Jason is a Senior Program Officer and Research Fellow at International Budget Partnership, April 23, 2009.

Government financing and involvement in a host of the programs described above create the expectation, if not direct pressure, on recipient groups to incorporate into their financed activities political promotions or to filter out negative representations of the government Access to government financing can also tempt local leaders to subvert the aims of their organization, and thus the interests it allegedly represents, in favor of government goals and/or their own personal benefit protagonists of such state-supported efforts to promote participatory democracy often actively work to retain their autonomy from their government benefactors government financing today, much like the party-led penetration of interest groups in Venezuela's earlier system, creates conditions ripe for cooptation and clientelistic control of local community leaders third similarity exposes the inability of either system to hold the government accountable. This similarity is the corruption endemic to both systems corruption today seems to take root among state officials who allocate funds for social programs that is, in the many state-sponsored efforts to promote participatory democracy state officials can too easily abuse their discretion over state funds to favor particular groups or friends and family or to siphon off resources for their own personal benefit.

It divides the world sharply into dichotomies tween the legitimate and ‘good’ state, and the illegitimate and ‘evil’ ‘terrorists these ‘problem-solving’ characteristics can also be shown to contribute directly to its observed shortcomings. The reported lack of primary data the dearth of interviews and the field’s typical unwillingness to ‘engage subjectively with motives’, State actors are engaged in counterterrorism, which is logically depicted as legitimate, or at least, ‘justifiable’ given the ‘terrorist threat’ and the field’s focus on shortterm ‘problem-solving’ The lack of critical and theoretical reflection can be linked to the ‘problem-solving’ tendency to be short-termist and practical, and to deal in fixed categories and dichotomies that privilege the state and its dominant ideological values The state-centricity, inflexibility and dichotomous nature of such a framework also makes it easier to recycle unproven assumptions, such as the notion that ‘religious terrorism’ is not concerned with constituencies and knows no tactical constraints against killing ‘infidels’ without having to test these assumptions empirically across different samples The result of these tendencies is support for coercive counterterrorism policy without adequate analysis of how this policy contributes to the reproduction of the very terrorist threat it seeks to eradicate\nDiscourse of terrorism in IR constructs the world in absolute dichotomies between legitimate state violence and illegitimate political violence.

Worst-case thinking means generally bad decision making it’s only half of the cost-benefit equation By speculating about what can possibly go wrong, and then acting as if that is likely to happen, worst-case thinking focuses only on the extreme but improbable risks and does a poor job at assessing outcomes it’s based on flawed logic.

Instead of focusing on what we know, it focuses on what we don’t know Ignorance isn’t a cause for doubt; when you can fill that ignorance with imagination, it can be a call to action it can lead to hasty and dangerous acts You can’t wait for a smoking gun, so you act as if the gun is about to go off.

Probabilistic thinking is repudiated in favor of \"possibilistic thinking Worst-case thinking leads to bad decisions, bad systems design, and bad security. Furedi, a sociology professor at the University of Kent, writes: \"Worst-case thinking encourages society to adopt fear as one of the dominant principles around which the public should organize their life. It institutionalizes insecurity and fosters a mood of confusion and powerlessness. Through popularizing the belief that worst cases are normal, it incites people to feel defenseless and vulnerable to a wide range of future threats.\" Even worse, it plays directly into the hands of terrorists, creating a population that is easily terrorized worst-case thinking is a way of looking at the world that exaggerates the rare and unusual and gives the rare much more credence than it deserves. It isn’t really a principle; it’s a cheap trick to justify what you already believe. It lets lazy or biased people make what seem to be cogent arguments without understanding the whole issue.

Are any of the species threatened with extinction necessary to the provision of any ecosystem service on which humans depend? If so, which ones are they? There is little ecological similarity, for example, between New England today and the land where the Pilgrims died. n353 In view of the constant reconfiguration of the biota, one may wonder why Americans have not suffered more as a result of ecological catastrophes. One might argue that the sheer number and variety of creatures available to any ecosystem buffers that system against stress. In the United States as in many other parts of the world, however, the number of species has been increasing dramatically, not decreasing, as a result of human activity. This is because the hordes of exotic species coming into ecosystems in the United States far exceed the number of species that are becoming extinct. The Ecological Society of America has urged managers to maintain biological diversity as a critical component in strengthening ecosystems against disturbance. n360 Yet as Levin observed, \"much of the detail about species composition will be irrelevant in terms of influences on ecosystem properties.\" biodiversity matters only up to a point; above a certain level, increasing biodiversity is likely to make little difference What about the use of plants and animals in agriculture? There is no scarcity foreseeable. \"Of an estimated 80,000 types of plants [we] know to be edible only about 150 are extensively cultivated.

The conceptual temporal paradox of assigning current prices based upon futures is not considered a problem, and this makes sense because grains can be stored for extended periods We review the empirical evidence for the role of speculation in food prices, which includes the timing of the food price spikes relative to the global financial crisis, the synchrony of food price spikes with other commodities that do not share supply and demand factors, the existence of large upwards and downwards movement of prices consistent with the expecta- tions of a bubble and bust cycle, statistical causality analysis of food prices increasing with commodity speculator activity, and an inability to account for the dynamics of prices with supply and demand equations despite many economic analyses The increase in food prices coincided with the financial crisis and followed the decline of the housing and stock markets. An economic crisis would be 13expected to result in a decrease in commodity prices due to a drop in demand from lower overall economic activity In addition to the timing of the peak in food prices after the stock market crash, the coin- cidence of peaks in unrelated commodities including food, precious and base metals, and oil indicates that speculation played a major role in the overall increase [138]. An explanation of the food price peaks in 2008 and 2011 based upon supply and demand must not only include an explanation of the rise in prices of multiple grains, including wheat, corn and rice, but must separately account for the rise in silver, oil and other prices. In contrast, speculator-driven commodity bubbles would coincide after the nancial crisis because of the synchronous movement of capital from the housing and stock markets to the commodity markets investor activity acts in the same direction across all commodities, without regard to their distinct supply and demand conditions An OECD study claiming that speculation played no role [139, 140], has been discounted due to invalid statistical methods [141].) Granger causality tests also show the influence of futures prices on spot market prices [81].

But that labor pool is now drying up. In recent years, we’ve seen a spate of headlines like this from CNBC: “California Farm Labor Shortage ‘Worst It’s Been, Ever’.” Typically, these stories blame drug-related violence on the Mexican border or tougher border enforcement for the decline. Hence the call for new guest-worker programs. But a new paper from U.C. Davis offers up a simpler explanation for the labor shortage. Mexico is getting richer. And, when a country gets richer, its pool of rural agricultural labor shrinks. Not only are Mexican workers shifting into other sectors like construction, but Mexico’s own farms are increasing wages. That means U.S. farms will have to pay higher and higher wages to attract a dwindling pool of available Mexican farm workers “It’s a simple story,” says Edward Taylor, an agricultural economist at U.C. Davis and one of the study’s authors. ”By the mid-twentieth century, Americans stopped doing farm work. And we were only able to avoid a farm-labor crisis by bringing in workers from a nearby country that was at an earlier stage of development. Now that era is coming to an end. Taylor and his co-authors argue that the United States could face a sharp adjustment period as a result. Americans appear unwilling to do the sort of low-wage farm work that we have long relied on immigrants to do.

About 56 percent of them are from Mexico As many as 85 percent of Mexicans who enter the United States each year do so illegally. There is a very strong relationship between availability of jobs in the U.S. and the flow of illegal immigration Massey said the goal of undocumented Mexicans in the U.S. is not to live in the country permanently but \"to use the U.S. labor market as an instrument to raise money to solve an economic problem at home.\" We've tried this experiment over the last 20 years of trying to integrate the North American economy without including labor, and it has backfired It has resulted in a record number of illegal people working in the United States.\" It's not because there was an increase in the inflow.

But they say some blame goes to the unintended consequences of Nafta. In some cases, Nafta produced results that were exactly the opposite of what was promised. For instance, domestic industries were dismantled as multinationals imported parts from their own suppliers. Local farmers were priced out of the market by food imported tariff-free. Many Mexican farmers simply abandoned their land and headed north. Although one-quarter of Mexicans live in the countryside, they account for 44 percent of the migrants to the United States. The contradictions of Nafta are apparent in Guadalajara and the rich farmland around it.   “A new phenomenon has grown up under Nafta — high-productivity poverty,” said Harley Shaiken, chairman of the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. Low wages means low purchasing power. “It is not a successful strategy for globalization,” Mr. Shaiken said. Even Nafta’s greatest success — exports — has become a liability, as Mexico feels the full brunt of declining consumption in the United States. . Foreign direct investment fell last year to $18.6 billion from $27.2 billion in 2007. will also find them seething over his signing of a spending bill that scrapped a pilot program allowing Mexican long-haul trucks to transport cargo throughout the United States. In retaliation, Mexico has imposed punitive tariffs on $2.4 billion worth of American goods. Nafta guaranteed Mexico, Canada and the United States access to one another’s highways for cargo transport by 2000. Perhaps the Mexicans least prepared for globalization were Mexico’s small farmers. “It isn’t possible for a peasant to make a living from the countryside,” said Francisco Vargas, president of an association that groups together 2,500 farmers from Etzatlán, about 90 minutes west of Guadalajara. The farmers hold other jobs to subsidize their farming. Mr. Vargas is a teacher. Another of the group’s leaders is a retired accountant; a third has a sideline renting out construction equipment. Some farmers continue thanks to money sent by relatives working in the United States. Farmers in the region have survived Nafta by raising corn yields through converting to modern farming techniques. They also lobby for government aid and band together to fight private oligopolies that sell seed and buy corn. But their landholdings remain small, sometimes not more than about 10 acres, and they are at the mercy of rising costs and fluctuating prices. Seed is up about 20 percent because of the peso’s devaluation, while corn is off the high of last year as global demand drops. The farmers say that they have raised their yields to double Mexico’s average of three metric tons per hectare, or more “Nafta was a great opportunity, but you had to build on it,” he said.\nNAFTA has killed Mexican Small farms—we’re on the brink\nMalkin 9 (Elizabeth Malkin March 23, 2009 “Nafta’s promise unfulfilled” Staff writer for the New York Times http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/business/worldbusiness/24peso.html?pagewanted=all)- RT", "metadata": {"topic": "Unknown", "citation": "Malkin 9 (Elizabeth Malkin March 23, 2009 “Nafta’s promise unfulfilled” Staff writer for the New York Times http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/business/worldbusiness/24peso.html?pagewanted=all)- RT", "camp": "Michigan (7-week)", "tag": "Unknown", "year": "2013", "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:10Z"}

The countryside wasn't supposed to hollow out in this way when the North American Free Trade Agreement linked Mexico, Canada and the U.S. in 1994. the agricultural elements of the pact were brutal on Mexico's corn farmers. A flood of U.S. corn imports, combined with subsidies that favor agribusiness, are blamed for the loss of 2 million farm jobs in Mexico. The trade pact worsened illegal migration, some experts say, particularly in areas where small farmers barely eke out a living. indigenous Mixtecs who till small plots of corn, beans and squash between stands of jacarandas, junipers and eucalyptus. Eagles soar in the brilliant blue skies. \"When they hit 18 and finish secondary school, they leave for the United States or other states of Mexico,\" Duran said If you go to the offices over there and ask for help,\" Duran said, nodding to the local agriculture agency, \"they say there isn't any to give.\" Mexican negotiators who signed the NAFTA agreement hoped that small corn farmers thrown out of work by rising imports of cheap U.S. corn would be absorbed into jobs in the fruit and vegetable export industry or in manufacturing. It's been roughly a tripling, quadrupling, quintupling of U.S. corn exports to Mexico, depending on the year,\" said Timothy A. Wise, the director of research and policy at the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. \"Is that a river? Yeah, that's a lot of corn.\" Representatives of small farmers say Mexico's policymakers tossed the dice that trade-spurred growth would take care of rural disruptions — and lost. \"The great failure of this supposition is that there wasn't economic growth that would absorb these people,\" said Victor Suarez, the executive director of the National Association of Rural Producers, which represents 60,000 small farmers.  .\" Faced with deepening poverty, rural migrants have tried to escape regions of Mexico that never used to be sources of emigration. \"In Chiapas, there was hardly any migration before NAFTA,\" Suarez said, referring to Mexico's southernmost state. \"Farm laborers were even brought in from Guatemala. Now, more than 50,000 rural people from Chiapas go each year to the United States. In fact, Mexican corn production has risen since the trade pact, driven by domestic agribusiness and supported by subsidies biased to favor large producers that by one estimate surpassed $20 billion in the past two decades. The Mexican government also has cash-transfer subsidies, known as ProCampo, for small farmers who are considered the free-trade pact's losers. But they reach only a portion of small corn growers, a quarter of whom are indigenous. Some rural farmers no longer have enough corn to sell, sinking into subsistence living for themselves and their families. Unless the central government tweaks subsidies to make more small family farms economically viable, the result may be sustained migrant flows, experts said. \"The government didn't so much pull the plug on corn. The government pulled the plug on family farmers who grow corn because the big guys who grew corn got massive subsidies and protection from imports several Mexican agro-industrial companies have become muscular global conglomerates. \"Before NAFTA, Grupo Bimbo was a big company. Now it is the largest industrial user of wheat in the world, Their powerful position in the market has kept prices high for consumers, while in the countryside, the social fabric frays as families disperse to find jobs.

Next Generation Manufacturing A dynamic manufacturing sector in the U.S. is as important as ever The latest wave of innovation in industrial technology has been termed “advanced manufacturing.” physical and biological sciences, for example, nanotechnology, chemistry, and biology. It involves both new ways to manufacture existing products and the manufacture of new products emerging from new advanced technologies areas in which advanced manufacturing will play a role are: Supercomputing America’s global leadership in technology depends in part on whether the U.S. can compete with Europe and Asia in the race to develop “exascale computing If the U.S. chooses to be a follower rather than a leader in exascale computing, we must be willing to cede leadership” in industries including aerospace, automobiles, energy, health care, novel material development, and information technology Robotics: The long-delayed promise of robotics is coming closer to fulfillment. Nanotech may permit manufacturing at extremely small scales including the molecular and atomic levels Biomanufacturing is the use of biological processes or living organisms to create inorganic structures, as well as food, drugs and fuel\nAll levels of manufacturing and R&D are interconnected – a sustainable manufacturing base in the U.S. is critical to Advanced Manufacturing and R&D\nLind 12 (Michael Lind is policy director of New America’s Economic Growth Program and a co-founder of the New America Foundation.
