About Business Ethics Business Ethics is designed to meet the scope and sequence requirements of the single-semester standardized business ethics course across all majors. This title includes innovative features designed to enhance student learning, including case studies, application scenarios, and links to video interviews with executives, all of which help instill in students a sense of ethical awareness and responsibility. The book provides an important opportunity for students to learn the core concepts of business ethics and understand how to apply those concepts to their professional lives. Coverage and scope Our Business Ethics textbook adheres to the scope and sequence requirements of introductory business ethics courses nationwide. We have endeavored to make the core theories and practical concepts of business ethics engaging, relevant, and accessible to students. The guiding themes of the textbook are to promote high ethical standards and to assist the integration of ethical thinking across the business school curriculum, with an end result of encouraging even greater ethical consciousness on the part of business practitioners beyond their graduation. We particularly emphasize the reality of today’s global business community and observe that geography, culture, and time contribute to ethical concepts and constructs. With awareness of these issues in mind, the content of this textbook has been developed and arranged to emphasize the necessity—and difficulty—of ethical decision-making. The authors seek to help students recognize legal and moral issues, reason through the consequences of different courses of action, and promote social responsibility. The text emphasizes connections between topics such as ethical theories, legal responsibilities, the prioritization of stakeholders, and corporate social responsibility. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from business ethics instructors dedicated to the project. Engaging feature boxes Throughout Business Ethics, you will find features that engage students by taking selected topics a step further. Each feature box contains either a link to a deeper exploration of the topic at hand or critical thinking questions that may be geared toward class discussion, student projects, or written essays. Our features include: • Cases from the Real World. This feature presents brief examples of real companies making ethical decisions in the midst of hectic competition. Each example includes follow-up critical thinking questions that encourage reflection on the case and how it relates to chapter concepts and themes. • What Would You Do? This feature presents brief, fact-based scenarios in which students are challenged to put themselves into the shoes of ranking executives and balance a host of interests—some conflicting—as they make decisions for their businesses. Students provide an answer to a practical problem or ethical issue, as well as their reasoning. • Ethics across Time and Cultures. This feature considers how geography, culture, and time influence the ethical values we have. Follow-up critical thinking questions allow for broader reflection on the chapter topics and encourage deeper integration of the chapter content. • Link to Learning. This feature provides a very brief introduction to online resources and videos that are pertinent to students’ exploration of the topic at hand. Link to Learning boxes allow students to connect easily to some of the most important thought leaders and concepts in the field of business ethics. The 2 Preface This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col25722/1.3 purpose is to highlight the complexities of ethical decision-making. Module materials that reinforce key concepts • Learning Objectives. Every module begins with a set of clear and concise learning objectives. These objectives are designed to help the instructor decide what content to include or assign, and to guide students on what they can expect to learn. After completing the module and end-of-module exercises, students should be able to demonstrate mastery of the learning objectives. • Summaries. Section summaries distill the information in each module for both students and instructors down to key, concise points addressed in the section. • Key Terms. Key terms are bold and are followed by a definition in context. Definitions of key terms are also listed in the glossary, which appears at the end of the chapter. • Assessments. Multiple-choice and short-answer review questions provide opportunities to recall and test the information students learn throughout each module. Additional resources Student and instructor resources We’ve compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting Started Guides, a test bank, and comprehensive PowerPoint slides.

Sobre Cálculo volumen 3 Cálculo está diseñado para el típico curso de cálculo general de dos o tres semestres, incorporando características innovadoras para mejorar el aprendizaje del estudiante. El libro guía a los estudiantes a través de los conceptos básicos del cálculo y los ayuda a entender cómo esos conceptos se aplican a sus vidas y al mundo que los rodea. Debido a la naturaleza integral del material, ofrecemos el libro en tres volúmenes para mayor flexibilidad y eficiencia. El volumen 3 abarca las ecuaciones paramétricas y las coordenadas polares, los vectores, las funciones de varias variables, la integración múltiple y las ecuaciones diferenciales de segundo orden. Cobertura y alcance Nuestro libro de texto de Cálculo volumen 3 se adhiere al alcance y la secuencia de la mayoría de los cursos de cálculo general en todo el país. Hemos trabajado para que el cálculo sea interesante y accesible para los estudiantes, a la vez que se mantiene el rigor matemático inherente a la asignatura. Con este objetivo en mente, el contenido de los tres volúmenes de Cálculo se han desarrollado y organizado para proporcionar una progresión lógica desde los conceptos fundamentales hasta los más avanzados, con base en lo que los estudiantes ya han aprendido y haciendo hincapié en las conexiones entre los temas y entre la teoría y las aplicaciones. La meta de cada sección es que los estudiantes no solo reconozcan los conceptos, sino que trabajen con estos de forma que les resulten útiles en cursos posteriores y en sus futuras carreras. La organización y las características pedagógicas se desarrollaron y examinaron con los aportes de Prefacio 1 educadores de matemáticas dedicados al proyecto. Volumen 1 • Capítulo 1: Funciones y gráficos • Capítulo 2: Límites • Capítulo 3: Derivadas • Capítulo 4: Aplicaciones de las derivadas • Capítulo 5: Integración • Capítulo 6: Aplicaciones de la integración Volumen 2 • Capítulo 1: Integración • Capítulo 2: Aplicaciones de la integración • Capítulo 3: Técnicas de integración • Capítulo 4: Introducción a las ecuaciones diferenciales • Capítulo 5: Secuencias y series • Capítulo 6: Serie de potencias • Capítulo 7: Ecuaciones paramétricas y coordenadas polares Volumen 3 • Capítulo 1: Ecuaciones paramétricas y coordenadas polares • Capítulo 2: Vectores en el espacio • Capítulo 3: Funciones de valores factoriales • Capítulo 4: Diferenciación de funciones de varias variables • Capítulo 5: Integración múltiple • Capítulo 6: Cálculo vectorial • Capítulo 7: Ecuaciones diferenciales de segundo orden Fundamentos pedagógicos A lo largo de Cálculo volumen 3 encontrará ejemplos y ejercicios que presentan ideas y técnicas clásicas, así como aplicaciones y métodos modernos. Las derivaciones y explicaciones se basan en años de experiencia en el aula por parte de profesores de cálculo de larga trayectoria, que se esfuerzan por lograr un equilibrio de claridad y rigor que ha demostrado ser exitoso con sus estudiantes. Las aplicaciones motivacionales abarcan temas importantes de probabilidad, biología, ecología, negocios y economía, así como áreas de física, química, ingeniería e informática. Los proyectos estudiantiles de cada capítulo ofrecen a los estudiantes la oportunidad de explorar interesantes aspectos secundarios de las matemáticas puras y aplicadas: desde la navegación de un giro en banco hasta la adaptación de un vehículo de alunizaje para una nueva misión a Marte. Las aplicaciones de apertura del capítulo plantean problemas que se resuelven más adelante, utilizando las ideas tratadas en ese capítulo. Los problemas incluyen la distancia promedio del cometa Halley con respecto al Sol, y el campo vectorial de un huracán. Se destacan definiciones, reglas y teoremas a lo largo del texto, incluyendo más de 60 pruebas de teoremas. Evaluaciones que refuerzan los conceptos clave Los ejemplos del capítulo guían a los estudiantes a través de los problemas al plantear una pregunta, exponer una solución y luego pedirles a los estudiantes que practiquen la habilidad con una pregunta del Punto de control. Asimismo, el libro incluye evaluaciones al final de cada capítulo para que los estudiantes puedan aplicar lo que han aprendido mediante problemas de práctica. Muchos ejercicios están marcados con una [T] para indicar que se pueden resolver con ayuda de la tecnología, lo que incluye calculadoras o sistemas de álgebra computacional (Computer Algebra Systems, CAS). Las respuestas de los ejercicios seleccionados están disponibles en una Clave de respuestas al final del libro. El libro también incluye evaluaciones al final de cada capítulo para que los estudiantes puedan aplicar lo que han aprendido mediante problemas de práctica. Enfoques trascendentales tempranos o tardíos Los tres volúmenes de Cálculo están diseñados para dar cabida a los enfoques trascendentales temprano y tardío del cálculo. Las funciones exponenciales y logarítmicas se introducen de manera informal en el capítulo 1 del volumen 1 y se presentan en términos más rigurosos en el capítulo 6 del volumen 1 y en el capítulo 2 del volumen 2. La diferenciación e integración de estas funciones se trata en los capítulos 3-5 del volumen 1 y en el capítulo 1 del volumen 2 para los instructores que quieran incluirlas con otros tipos de funciones. Estas discusiones, sin embargo, se encuentran en secciones separadas que pueden ser omitidas por los instructores que prefieren esperar hasta que se den las definiciones integrales antes de enseñar las derivaciones de cálculo de exponenciales y logaritmos. 2 Prefacio Acceso gratis en openstax.org Amplio programa artístico Nuestro programa artístico está diseñado para mejorar la comprensión de los estudiantes de los conceptos a través de ilustraciones, diagramas y fotografías claros y eficaces.

About Calculus Volume 2 Calculus is designed for the typical two- or three-semester general calculus course, incorporating innovative features to enhance student learning. The book guides students through the core concepts of calculus and helps them understand how those concepts apply to their lives and the world around them. Due to the comprehensive nature of the material, we are offering the book in three volumes for flexibility and efficiency. Volume 2 covers integration, differential equations, sequences and series, and parametric equations and polar coordinates. Coverage and Scope Our Calculus Volume 2 textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most general calculus courses nationwide. We have worked to make calculus interesting and accessible to students while maintaining the mathematical rigor inherent in the subject. With this objective in mind, the content of the three volumes of Calculus have been developed and arranged to provide a logical progression from fundamental to more advanced concepts, building upon what students have already learned and emphasizing connections between topics and between theory and applications. The goal of each section is to enable students not just to recognize concepts, but work with them in ways that will be useful in later courses and future careers. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from mathematics educators dedicated to the project. Volume 1 Preface 1 Chapter 1: Functions and Graphs Chapter 2: Limits Chapter 3: Derivatives Chapter 4: Applications of Derivatives Chapter 5: Integration Chapter 6: Applications of Integration Volume 2 Chapter 1: Integration Chapter 2: Applications of Integration Chapter 3: Techniques of Integration Chapter 4: Introduction to Differential Equations Chapter 5: Sequences and Series Chapter 6: Power Series Chapter 7: Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates Volume 3 Chapter 1: Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates Chapter 2: Vectors in Space Chapter 3: Vector-Valued Functions Chapter 4: Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables Chapter 5: Multiple Integration Chapter 6: Vector Calculus Chapter 7: Second-Order Differential Equations Pedagogical Foundation Throughout Calculus Volume 2 you will find examples and exercises that present classical ideas and techniques as well as modern applications and methods. Derivations and explanations are based on years of classroom experience on the part of long-time calculus professors, striving for a balance of clarity and rigor that has proven successful with their students. Motivational applications cover important topics in probability, biology, ecology, business, and economics, as well as areas of physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science. Student Projects in each chapter give students opportunities to explore interesting sidelights in pure and applied mathematics, from showing that the number e is irrational, to calculating the center of mass of the Grand Canyon Skywalk or the terminal speed of a skydiver. Chapter Opening Applications pose problems that are solved later in the chapter, using the ideas covered in that chapter. Problems include the hydraulic force against the Hoover Dam, and the comparison of the relative intensity of two earthquakes. Definitions, Rules, and Theorems are highlighted throughout the text, including over 60 Proofs of theorems. Assessments That Reinforce Key Concepts In-chapter Examples walk students through problems by posing a question, stepping out a solution, and then asking students to practice the skill with a “Check Your Learning” component. The book also includes assessments at the end of each chapter so students can apply what they’ve learned through practice problems. Many exercises are marked with a [T] to indicate they are suitable for solution by technology, including calculators or Computer Algebra Systems (CAS). Answers for selected exercises are available in the Answer Key at the back of the book. The book also includes assessments at the end of each chapter so students can apply what they’ve learned through practice problems. Early or Late Transcendentals Calculus Volume 2 is designed to accommodate both Early and Late Transcendental approaches to calculus. Exponential and logarithmic functions are presented in Chapter 2. Integration of these functions is covered in Chapters 1 for instructors who want to include them with other types of functions. These discussions, however, are in separate sections that can be skipped for instructors who prefer to wait until the integral definitions are given before teaching the calculus derivations of exponentials and logarithms. Comprehensive Art Program Our art program is designed to enhance students’ understanding of concepts through clear and effective illustrations, 2 Preface This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11965/1.2 diagrams, and photographs.

About Introduction to Intellectual Property This unique resource provides a clear, effective introduction to the legal issues and applications of Intellectual Property. The book is directed at students and ordinary citizens with no formal background in the field, and who may be studying entrepreneurship, marketing, computer science, engineering, or other fields. It is useful in an array of courses ranging from Business Law and Product Design to Information Systems and many Preface 1 others. Introduction to Intellectual Property covers patent basics and enforcement, copyright, trademark, and trade secrets. Each chapter is authored by an expert in the respective field, all under the guidance of principal author David Kline and executive editor David Kappos. The luminaries involved with this project represent the forefront of knowledge and experience on these topics, which makes the text an even more valuable resource for instructors, students, and professionals. While informative for anyone with a professional or personal interest in intellectual property, this resource is a formal textbook, and is designed for the effective instruction of college students. Each chapter contains learning objectives, subsections, and topically oriented review questions. Introduction to Intellectual Property was originally developed by the Michelson 20MM Foundation, released under the title The Intangible Advantage. It remains available along with an accompanying online course, video series, and other resources. Visit https://michelsonip.com/intangible-advantage/ for more information, and see below for more detailed descriptions of these assets. About the Authors Senior Contributing Authors David Kline David Kline was a Pulitzer-Prize-nominated journalist and author who covered some of the world’s most important stories over the last 30 years for the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Christian Science Monitor, Rolling Stone, the Atlantic, Harvard Business Review, CBS and NBC TV, and other national media. He was also a contributing writer for Wired magazine for many years. In more recent years, Kline wrote on a variety of business and technology topics, with a special focus on intellectual property issues. His bestselling book Rembrandts in the Attic from Harvard Business Press is considered the seminal work on patent strategy within corporate America, and it has helped to shape the direction of corporate and policy-maker thinking on patent issues. In 2016, Kline was named one of the “World’s Top 300 Intellectual Property Strategists” by Intellectual Asset Management magazine. David Kappos David Kappos is widely recognized as one of the world’s foremost leaders in the field of intellectual property, including intellectual property management and strategy, the development of global intellectual property norms, laws and practices as well as commercialization and enforcement of innovation based assets. From August 2009 to January 2013, Mr. Kappos served as Under Secretary of Commerce and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). In that role, he advised the President, Secretary of Commerce and the Administration on intellectual property policy matters. As Director of the USPTO, he led the Agency in dramatically reengineering its entire management and operational systems as well as its engagement with the global innovation community. He was instrumental in achieving the greatest legislative reform of the U.S. patent system in generations through passage and implementation of the Leahy Smith America Invents Act, signed into law by the President in September 2011.

That’s all I ever wanted to be, ever since the day I sat at my grandmother’s kitchen table—I must have been seven years old—and smelled her flesh burning on the stove. You see, my grandmother suffered from syringomyelia, a crippling spinal disease that results in terrible back pain and the loss of sensation to pain and temperature in the extremities, especially the hands. When I saw the flames licking up through her fingers that day, I screamed, and she quickly doused her hand in the sink. “Don’t worry,” she told me. “One day you’ll become a doctor and you’ll fix me.” Some 20 years later, I had graduated medical school and completed a residency in orthopedic surgery, and was doing a fellowship in spinal surgery at St. Luke’s Medical Center in Houston when I stumbled upon a problem in an otherwise routine case. The case was a discectomy—the removal of a ruptured disk that is pressing on a nerve root. I noticed that because the disc had ruptured slowly over time, it had created a bone spur, which was like a little rhinoceros horn of bone, as hard as ivory. So I asked myself, How is taking out that disc going to help the patient if the bone spur is going to cause him pain for the rest of his life? I wanted to take that bone spur out, but I knew of no way to do that because it was sticking straight up about five inches down inside a narrow little hole in the patient’s back. So I asked a very famous surgeon in the hospital, “How do you get that bone spur out?” “Do not put a high speed burr in there and attempt to grind it down,” he said. He had tried that once, and ended up damaging the patient’s spinal cord and paralyzing her for life. That sounded to me like a pretty strong argument against trying that approach again. Then I asked the head of my fellowship program, “How do I get that bone spur out?” He explained that he once tried using a grabber instrument called a ronguer to try to break off the bone spur. But the pressure exerted on the instrument caused it to explode, sending fragments all throughout the dural sac. Luckily, he was able to retrieve the pieces and repair the damage. But once again, here was an approach that didn’t exactly recommend itself. Preface 3 No matter which spine expert I asked, the response was always the same. They all told me what not to do. Leave the bone spur alone, they said—just sew up the patient and send him home, even if it means dooming him to a lifetime of pain. Be content to follow the age-old motto of the physician, “First, do no harm.” Be content? George Bernard Shaw once said that inventors are a disgruntled lot. And I must have been pretty disgruntled with the lack of any solution for that bone spur, because I decided to invent a solution myself. Instead of trying to grind down the spur (with potentially disastrous results) or break it off (again, with potentially disastrous results), I came up with a counterintuitive approach. You see, I realized that while a bone spur itself is the hardest bone known to man, it sits atop the vertebrae, the inside of which is much softer and more mesh-like. What if I tried tapping the spur into the softer vertebrae? I found a tool normally used for an entirely different purpose and thought it might suffice for the job. And the next time I had a discectomy case with a bone spur, I tried out my new tool. I tapped the bone spur lightly with it, but nothing happened. I tapped it again, harder, but still nothing happened. Then I tapped it really hard, and that’s when I heard a “pop” and felt the instrument suddenly sink down. Now, I knew I couldn’t have damaged any nerves or structures because I had retractors holding the nerve and the dural sac out of the way. But when I looked inside, I could not see the bone spur anywhere. It was gone. And I thought, “Uh-oh.” So I brought in an x-ray machine and looked for the bone spur. It turned out the spur had corked the very hole that I had created when I broke it off and pushed it into the vertebrae—like a cork in a bottle. There wasn’t a drop of blood anywhere, and no damage to any tissue. In other words, my procedure was self-sealing! To this day, it remains the best solution for this problem. Over the next few months, I designed a set of instruments better suited to removing bone spurs no matter where they were located in the spinal canal. I gave the drawings to a machinist, and he created the tools according to my design. Soon I was using them routinely on bone spur cases, and getting such good results that other surgeons started sending me their bone spur cases. But eventually, these surgeons began asking me to provide them with a set of tools of their own. I said sure, and for each request, I would ask my machinist to fabricate another set of tools. Finally, the machinist told me that it would be cheaper just to make a hundred sets at once, since the major cost of fabricating the tools was in setting up the jigs on the machine. I thought that made perfect sense. After all, the demand for the tools from other surgeons was growing. In addition, I was disgruntled enough with the standard of care in other areas of spinal treatment that I had already invented several other new spinal surgery tools. So I started a little company to sell my tools and devices. I quickly realized, of course, that I needed to patent my inventions to protect all the time, money, and effort that I had invested to develop them. After all, if you don’t patent your inventions, especially in a competitive industry like medical devices, others will simply copy those inventions with impunity and sell them at a lower cost because they didn’t have to invest anything to develop them in the first place. That’s a great way to drive the innovators out of any industry and halt any f...", "metadata": {"title": "Introduction_to_Intellectual_Property_2PYaEdp", "book": null, "chapter": null, "section": null, "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:12Z"}

About Principles of Macroeconomics 3e Principles of Macroeconomics 3e aligns to the topics and objectives of most introductory microeconomics courses. The text uses conversational language and ample illustrations to explore economic theories, and provides a wide array of examples using both fictional and real-world scenarios. The third edition has been carefully and thoroughly updated to reflect current data and understanding, as well as to provide a deeper background in diverse contributors and their impacts on economic thought and analysis. Preface 1 Coverage and scope In response to faculty feedback and to ease transition to a new edition, Principles of Macroeconomics 3e retains the organization of the previous editions. The book covers the breadth of economics topics and also provides the necessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for instructors and students alike. We strove to balance theory and application, as well as the amount of calculation and mathematical examples. The book is organized into seven main parts: • What is Economics? The first two chapters introduce students to the study of economics with a focus on making choices in a world of scarce resources. • Supply and Demand, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics: supply, demand, and equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance. • Elasticity and Price, Chapter 5, introduces and explains elasticity and price, two key concepts in economics. • The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals, Chapters 6 through 10, introduces a number of key concepts in macro: economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital flows. • A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis, Chapters 11 through 13, introduces the principal analytic model in macro, namely the aggregate demand/aggregate supply Model. The model is then applied to the Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives. The expenditure-output model is fully explained in a stand- alone appendix. • Monetary and Fiscal Policy, Chapters 14 through 18, explains the role of money and the banking system, as well as monetary policy and financial regulation. Then the discussion switches to government deficits and fiscal policy. • International Economics, Chapters 19 through 21, the final part of the text, introduces the international dimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.

About Preparing for College Success Preparing for College Success is designed to meet the needs of college preparation courses for high school students. Because a college preparation course may vary greatly from school to school or district to district, this high school edition has been developed to provide the most flexibility possible for course coordinators and teachers. The open license and multiple formats provide many opportunities to tailor the material to meet Preface 1 classroom or program-specific needs. The basis for this high school edition, College Success and College Success Concise, addresses the evolving challenges and opportunities of today's diverse students. The intensive development work leveraged expertise from hundreds of FYE coordinators and faculty across the country. In particular, this high school version was crafted with the input of high school teachers who have offered a course on preparing students to apply and go to college after graduation. The topics have been carefully chosen to prioritize the most critical topics in helping students prepare for the expectations and opportunities of college, and the authors have organized them to create a logical and reinforcing flow. While the content mirrors the College Success Concise book, this version includes a chapter on researching the best options after high school and applying to college. Users will see distinctive additions in certain areas, such as a new section on group work and greatly expanded coverage of stress, social media, and wellbeing. All of this content provides high school teachers the opportunity to prepare their students to research postsecondary pathways and make an informed decision about where to attend. This high school edition also gives students an introduction to the mindsets, behaviors, habits, and strategies they need to be successful throughout their entire college career. While some content was removed in creating this derivative, our open license and platform allow instructors and students to reliably utilize content from the original College Success text. As with all of our books, instructors can link to individual textbook sections or utilize the various means of customization. Preparing for College Success shares the vision and approach of the original textbook, and is rooted in core values of motivation, growth mindset, student support, and equity. The material highlights resources available to students as they embark on new roads of independence and responsibility. Within the chapters, students are given the opportunity to engage in self-analysis and reflection in order to understand their strengths, challenges, and aptitudes. Faculty and students will see the following consistent themes and approaches: Student engagement and self-analysis are reflected in each section through applications and activities. The diversity and intersectionality of students were considered in every example, context, and application, and the text's active surveys and detailed profiles make student voices a key element of the reading. Interconnected topics are acknowledged and built upon, demonstrating that no element of college learning and growth occurs in isolation. The result is a cumulative, more complete understanding, which better prepares students to meet the multi-dimensional challenges of higher education. Openly licensed and free in all digital formats, the text provides unparalleled flexibility in its use, customization, and accessibility for faculty and students. The book is provided at no cost in online, PDF, and other formats. It is also available in print for a very low price. Robust instructor ancillaries will support faculty and course designers with teaching notes, additional exercises, worksheet versions of the in-text activities, lecture slides, and assessment items. Features • Student Profiles: The voices of real students inform every chapter. These students grapple with the same concepts, from improving study skills to embracing diversity, and through their experiences and successes we share important stories. • Get Connected: Apps, websites, and technology that our experts recommend to help students face the challenges of college, develop critical academic and professional skills, and increase their overall success. • Analysis and Applications: Peppered through every chapter are opportunities for students to reflect on concepts, try out processes, and apply what they're learning. • Student Surveys: Chapters begin with a survey, posing questions that will get readers engaged in considering their own level of connection and understanding of the chapter's concept, from time management to personal finance to career planning. • Student Stories: Each chapter opens with a character-driven story about one of three different students. 2 Preface Access for free at openstax.org These stories provide a glimpse into the complexity of emotions, behaviors, mindsets, and decisions they will make. • The Real Deal: This feature offers advice and words of encouragement from college students about how to transition to college successfully. Real students were asked to tell their high school selves what they wished they'd known; these are the words of wisdom learned from their experiences. • Friends & Family Matter: A character-driven scenario is introduced in which a student is faced with making a choice. Readers are asked to think critically about the situation and to talk through the decision with friends and family. • Checking In: Your College Readiness Checklist: This feature offers a four-year, term-by-term checklist for students to track the tasks necessary for meeting college readiness standards and for applying to college. • Summary & Next Steps for College Success: A summary of the chapter’s main points comes at the end of each chapter and includes a checklist for what to do when they are in college. Estimated Module Completion Time Each section of Preparing for College Success includes an estimate of the average time needed to read through the material and work on the activities and applications. Each student will engage the material differently, and faculty will likely prioritize or assign certain components over others. As a result, the actual time students spend will vary greatly. OpenStax will periodically update these estimates based on user feedback. Answers to Questions in the Book Answers to the \"Questions to Consider\" questions are not provided to students due to the high variability of responses. The Instructor's Manual on the Instructor Resources page provides additional insight to assist in discussion about these questions. There is also a Test Bank of questions and answers only available to the instructor. Additional Resources Student and Instructor Resources We've compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting Started Guides, lecture slides, and a Test Bank. The most robust of these is the Instructor Resource Manual, developed by author Amy Baldwin based on extensive experience and requests from faculty reviewers and survey respondents. For each chapter, the IRM will contain: • Detailed teaching suggestions • Bloom's Taxonomy matrix, indicating the alignment of each chapter activity and application to the level of Bloom's it fulfills. • Overarching “big picture” questions from the chapter • Topical and cumulative case scenario activities, which present a realistic situation based on the concepts, and ask students to respond via writing or another method. These may be adapted and assigned by instructors. Instructor resources require a verified instructor account, which you can apply for when you log in or create your account on OpenStax.org. Instructor and student resources are typically available within a few months after the book's initial publication. Take advantage of these resources to supplement your OpenStax book. Academic Integrity Academic integrity builds trust, understanding, equity, and genuine learning. While students may encounter significant challenges in their courses and their lives, doing their own work and maintaining a high degree of authenticity will result in meaningful outcomes that will extend far beyond their college career. Faculty, Preface 3 administrators, resource providers, and students should work together to maintain a fair and positive experience. We realize that students benefit when academic integrity ground rules are established early in the course. To that end, OpenStax has created an interactive to aid with academic integrity discussions in your course.

About Principles of Marketing Summary Principles of Marketing is targeted at the core marketing course for undergraduate business majors and minors. The book is designed for conceptual accessibility to students who are relatively early in their business curriculum (such as second-year students), yet it is also suitable for more advanced students. Due to the wide range of audiences and course approaches, the book is designed to be as flexible as possible. It provides a solid grounding in the core concepts and frameworks of marketing theory and analysis so that business students interested in a major or minor in marketing will also be prepared for more rigorous upper-level courses. Concepts are reinforced through detailed and realistic company and organization scenarios and examples from various industries and geographical locations. Principles of Marketing also includes a diverse array of organizations so that students can see themselves and relate to the key concepts discussed. Preface 1 Pedagogical Foundation Principles of Marketing emphasizes marketing concepts relevant to people working in a variety of business functions. To illuminate the meaningful applications and implications of marketing ideas, the book incorporates a modern approach, providing connections between topics, solutions, and real-world problems. This multifaceted framework drives the integration of concepts while maintaining a modular chapter structure. Theoretical and practical aspects are presented in a balanced manner. Principles of Marketing exposes students to a diverse range of for-profit and nonprofit organizations, industries, products, brands, and services. Table of Contents Employability, companies demonstrating ethical awareness, and marketing metrics are strong themes incorporated throughout most chapters. While chapters are written to be independent, they do generally build on the understanding gained in the previous chapters.
