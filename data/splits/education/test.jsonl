FOUNDATION SUPPORT OpenStax is grateful for the tremendous support of our sponsors. Without their strong engagement, the goal of free access to high-quality textbooks would remain just a dream. Laura and John Arnold Foundation (LJAF) actively seeks opportunities to invest in organizations and thought leaders that have a sincere interest in implementing fundamental changes that not only yield immediate gains, but also repair broken systems for future generations. LJAF currently focuses its strategic investments on education, criminal justice, research integrity, and public accountability. The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation has been making grants since 1967 to help solve social and environmental problems at home and around the world. The Foundation concentrates its resources on activities in education, the environment, global development and population, performing arts, and philanthropy, and makes grants to support disadvantaged communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. Calvin K. Kazanjian was the founder and president of Peter Paul (Almond Joy), Inc. He firmly believed that the more people understood about basic economics the happier and more prosperous they would be. Accordingly, he established the Calvin K. Kazanjian Economics Foundation Inc, in 1949 as a philanthropic, nonpolitical educational organization to support efforts that enhanced economic understanding. Guided by the belief that every life has equal value, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation works to help all people lead healthy, productive lives. In developing countries, it focuses on improving people’s health with vaccines and other life-saving tools and giving them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty. In the United States, it seeks to significantly improve education so that all young people have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Based in Seattle, Washington, the foundation is led by CEO Jeff Raikes and Co-chair William H. Gates Sr., under the direction of Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett. The Maxfield Foundation supports projects with potential for high impact in science, education, sustainability, and other areas of social importance. Our mission at The Michelson 20MM Foundation is to grow access and success by eliminating unnecessary hurdles to affordability.

About Algebra and Trigonometry 2e Algebra and Trigonometry 2e provides a comprehensive exploration of algebraic principles and meets scope and sequence requirements for a typical introductory algebra and trigonometry course. The modular approach and the richness of content ensures that the book meets the needs of a variety of courses. Algebra and Trigonometry 2e offers a wealth of examples with detailed, conceptual explanations, building a strong foundation in the material before asking students to apply what they’ve learned. Coverage and Scope In determining the concepts, skills, and topics to cover, we engaged dozens of highly experienced instructors with a range of student audiences. The resulting scope and sequence proceeds logically while allowing for a significant amount of flexibility in instruction. Chapters 1 and 2 provide both a review and foundation for study of functions that begins in Chapter 3. The authors recognize that while some institutions may find this material a prerequisite, other institutions have told us that they have a cohort that needs the prerequisite skills built into the course. • Chapter 1: Prerequisites • Chapter 2: Equations and Inequalities Chapters 3-6: The Algebraic Functions • Chapter 3: Functions Preface 1 • Chapter 4: Linear Functions • Chapter 5: Polynomial and Rational Functions • Chapter 6: Exponential and Logarithm Functions Chapters 7-10: A Study of Trigonometry • Chapter 7: The Unit Circle: Sine and Cosine Functions • Chapter 8: Periodic Functions • Chapter 9: Trigonometric Identities and Equations • Chapter 10: Further Applications of Trigonometry Chapters 11-13: Further Study in Algebra and Trigonometry • Chapter 11: Systems of Equations and Inequalities • Chapter 12: Analytic Geometry • Chapter 13: Sequences, Probability, and Counting Theory Development Overview OpenStax Algebra and Trigonometry 2e is the product of a collaborative effort by a group of dedicated authors, editors, and instructors whose collective passion for this project has resulted in a text that is remarkably unified in purpose and voice. Special thanks is due to our Lead Author, Jay Abramson of Arizona State University, who provided the overall vision for the book and oversaw the development of each and every chapter, drawing up the initial blueprint, reading numerous drafts, and assimilating field reviews into actionable revision plans for our authors and editors. The collective experience of our author team allowed us to pinpoint the subtopics, exceptions, and individual connections that give students the most trouble. The textbook is therefore replete with well-designed features and highlights which help students overcome these barriers. As the students read and practice, they are coached in methods of thinking through problems and internalizing mathematical processes. Accuracy of the Content We understand that precision and accuracy are imperatives in mathematics, and undertook a dedicated accuracy program led by experienced faculty.Examples, art, problems, and solutions were reviewed by dedicated faculty, with a separate team evaluating the answer key and solutions. The text also benefits from years of usage by thousands of faculty and students. A core aspect of the second edition revision process included consolidating and ensuring consistency with regard to any errata and corrections that have been during in the series' extensive usage and incorporation into homework systems. Changes to the Second Edition The Algebra and Trigonometry 2e revision focused on mathematical clarity and accuracy as well as inclusivity. Examples, Exercises, and Solutions were reviewed by multiple faculty experts. All improvement suggestions and errata updates, driven by faculty and students from several thousand colleges, were considered and unified across the different formats of the text. OpenStax and our authors are aware of the difficulties posed by shifting problem and exercise numbers when textbooks are revised. In an effort to make the transition to the 2nd edition as seamless as possible, we have minimized any shifting of exercise numbers. The revision also focused on supporting inclusive and welcoming learning experiences. The introductory narratives, example and problem contexts, and even many of the names used for fictional people in the text were all reviewed using a diversity, equity, and inclusion framework. Several hundred resulting revisions improve the balance and relevance to the students using the text, while maintaining a variety of applications to diverse careers and academic fields. In particular, explanations of scientific and historical aspects of mathematics have been expanded to include more contributors. For example, the authors added additional historical and multicultural context regarding what is widely known as Pascal’s Triangle, and similarly added details regarding the international process of decoding the Enigma machine (including the role of Polish college students). Several chapter opening narratives and in-chapter references are completely new, and contexts across all chapters were specifically reviewed for equity in gender representation and connotation. Finally, prior to the release of this edition, OpenStax published a series of Corequisite Skillsheets to support different models and approaches to instruction. These remain available, and are described in more detail below. 2 Preface Access for free at openstax.org Pedagogical Foundations and Features Learning Objectives Each chapter is divided into multiple sections (or modules), each of which is organized around a set of learning objectives. The learning objectives are listed explicitly at the beginning of each section and are the focal point of every instructional element Narrative text Narrative text is used to introduce key concepts, terms, and definitions, to provide real-world context, and to provide transitions between topics and examples. Throughout this book, we rely on a few basic conventions to highlight the most important ideas: • Key terms are boldfaced, typically when first introduced and/or when formally defined. • Key concepts and definitions are called out in a blue box for easy reference. Examples Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples, that demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. The multiple Examples model different approaches to the same type of problem, or introduce similar problems of increasing complexity. All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. The question clearly lays out a mathematical problem to solve. The Solution walks through the steps, usually providing context for the approach—in other words, why the instructor is solving the problem in a specific manner. Finally, the Analysis (for select Examples) reflects on the broader implications of the Solution just shown. Examples are followed by a Try It question, as explained below. Figures Algebra and Trigonometry 2e contains more than 2000 figures and illustrations, the vast majority of which are graphs and diagrams. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style, drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions. Color contrast is employed with discretion to distinguish between the different functions or features of a graph. Supporting Features Several elements contribute to and check understanding. • A “How To” is a list of steps necessary to solve a certain type of problem. A How To typically precedes an Example that proceeds to demonstrate the steps in action. • A “Try It” exercise immediately follows an Example or a set of related Examples, providing the student with an immediate opportunity to solve a similar problem. In the PDF and the Web View version of the text, answers to the Try It exercises are located in the Answer Key. • A Q&A may appear at any point in the narrative, but most often follows an Example. This feature pre-empts misconceptions by posing a commonly asked yes/no question, followed by a detailed answer and explanation. • The “Media” icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Section Exercises. This icon marks a list Preface 3 of links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section.

This feature pre-empts misconceptions by posing a commonly asked yes/no question, followed by a detailed answer and explanation. • The Media icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Section Exercises. This icon marks a list of links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section. While we have selected tutorials that closely align to our learning objectives, we did not produce these tutorials, nor were they specifically produced or tailored to accompany College Algebra 2e. Section Exercises Each section of every chapter concludes with a well-rounded set of exercises that can be assigned as homework or used selectively for guided practice. With over 4600 exercises across the 9 chapters, instructors should have plenty from which to choose. Section Exercises are organized by question type, and generally appear in the following order: • Verbal questions assess conceptual understanding of key terms and concepts. • Algebraic problems require students to apply algebraic manipulations demonstrated in the section. • Graphical problems assess students’ ability to interpret or produce a graph. • Numeric problems require the student to perform calculations or computations. • Technology problems encourage exploration through use of a graphing utility, either to visualize or verify algebraic results or to solve problems via an alternative to the methods demonstrated in the section. Preface 3 • Extensions pose problems more challenging than the Examples demonstrated in the section. They require students to synthesize multiple learning objectives or apply critical thinking to solve complex problems. • Real-World Applications present realistic problem scenarios from fields such as physics, geology, biology, finance, and the social sciences. Chapter Review Features Each chapter concludes with a review of the most important takeaways, as well as additional practice problems that students can use to prepare for exams. • Key Terms provides a formal definition for each bold-faced term in the chapter. • Key Equations presents a compilation of formulas, theorems, and standard-form equations. • Key Concepts summarizes the most important ideas introduced in each section, linking back...", "metadata": {"title": "College-Algebra-2e-WEB", "book": null, "chapter": null, "section": null, "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:11Z"}

Laura and John Arnold Foundation (LJAF) actively seeks opportunities to invest in organizations and thought leaders that have a sincere interest in implementing fundamental changes that not only yield immediate gains, but also repair broken systems for future generations. LJAF currently focuses its strategic investments on education, criminal justice, research integrity, and public accountability. The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation has been making grants since 1967 to help solve social and environmental problems at home and around the world. The Foundation concentrates its resources on activities in education, the environment, global development and population, performing arts, and philanthropy, and makes grants to support disadvantaged communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. Calvin K. Kazanjian was the founder and president of Peter Paul (Almond Joy), Inc. He firmly believed that the more people understood about basic economics the happier and more prosperous they would be. Accordingly, he established the Calvin K. Kazanjian Economics Foundation Inc, in 1949 as a philanthropic, nonpolitical educational organization to support efforts that enhanced economic understanding. Guided by the belief that every life has equal value, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation works to help all people lead healthy, productive lives.

About Microbiology Microbiology is designed to cover the scope and sequence requirements for the single-semester Microbiology course for non-majors. The book presents the core concepts of microbiology with a focus on applications for careers in allied health. The pedagogical features of Microbiology make the material interesting and accessible to students while maintaining the career-application focus and scientific rigor inherent in the subject matter. Coverage and Scope The scope and sequence of Microbiology has been developed and vetted with input from numerous instructors at institutions across the US. It is designed to meet the needs of most microbiology courses for non-majors and allied health students. In addition, we have also considered the needs of institutions that offer microbiology to a mixed audience of science majors and non-majors by frequently integrating topics that may not have obvious clinical relevance, such as environmental and applied microbiology and the history of science. With these objectives in mind, the content of this textbook has been arranged in a logical progression from fundamental to more advanced concepts. The opening chapters present an overview of the discipline, with individual chapters focusing on microscopy and cellular biology as well as each of the classifications of microorganisms. Students then explore the foundations of microbial biochemistry, metabolism, and genetics, topics that provide a basis for understanding the various means by which we can control and combat microbial growth. Beginning with Chapter 15, the focus turns to microbial pathogenicity, emphasizing how interactions Preface 1 between microbes and the human immune system contribute to human health and disease. The last several chapters of the text provide a survey of medical microbiology, presenting the characteristics of microbial diseases organized by body system. A brief Table of Contents follows. While we have made every effort to align the Table of Contents with the needs of our audience, we recognize that some instructors may prefer to teach topics in a different order. A particular strength of Microbiology is that instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom. • Chapter 1: An Invisible World • Chapter 2: How We See the Invisible World • Chapter 3: The Cell • Chapter 4: Prokaryotic Diversity • Chapter 5: The Eukaryotes of Microbiology • Chapter 6: Acellular Pathogens • Chapter 7: Microbial Biochemistry • Chapter 8: Microbial Metabolism • Chapter 9: Microbial Growth • Chapter 10: Biochemistry of the Genome • Chapter 11: Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics • Chapter 12: Modern Applications of Microbial Genetics • Chapter 13: Control of Microbial Growth • Chapter 14: Antimicrobial Drugs • Chapter 15: Microbial Mechanisms of Pathogenicity • Chapter 16: Disease and Epidemiology • Chapter 17: Innate Nonspecific Host Defenses • Chapter 18: Adaptive Specific Host Defenses • Chapter 19: Diseases of the Immune System • Chapter 20: Laboratory Analysis of the Immune Response • Chapter 21: Skin and Eye Infections • Chapter 22: Respiratory System Infections • Chapter 23: Urogenital System Infections • Chapter 24: Digestive System Infections • Chapter 25: Circulatory and Lymphatic System Infections • Chapter 26: Nervous System Infections • Appendix A: Fundamentals of Physics and Chemistry Important to Microbiology • Appendix B: Mathematical Basics • Appendix C: Metabolic Pathways • Appendix D: Taxonomy of Clinically Relevant Microorganisms • Appendix E: Glossary American Society of Microbiology (ASM) Partnership Microbiology is produced through a collaborative publishing agreement between OpenStax and the American Society for Microbiology Press.

Access for free at openstax.org DEDICATION AND PREFACE This 10th edition of Organic Chemistry is dedicated to the memory of my son, Peter McMurry, who passed away in 2019 after a lifelong struggle with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). He was brilliant, strong, and truly the kindest person I have ever known. Peter McMurry 12/10/1968 – 12/12/2019 Just about every first-year medical student at New York Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia Medical Center knew and admired Peter, who was asked every year to meet and speak with incoming students about his experiences as a patient. He always enjoyed talking to the students, kidding them about their having had to take organic chemistry in college, and asking them if anyone recognized his last name from their O-Chem textbook. If Peter were still alive, I have no doubt that he would want me to work on this 10th edition with a publisher that would give the book away free to students rather than with one that would charge a large amount. So that is what I have done. To make this possible, I am not receiving any payment for this book, and generous supporters have not only covered the production costs but have also made a donation of $500,000 to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to help find a cure for this terrible disease. Anything that readers of this book might donate in Peter’s memory to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (https://openstax.org/l/22cystfibrofoun) would also be much appreciated. John McMurry Preface 1 Please note: this is a preliminary version containing Chapters 1-12 of Organic Chemistry: A Tenth Edition. Welcome to Organic Chemistry: A Tenth Edition, an OpenStax resource.

From the author—About Organic Chemistry: A Tenth Edition Organic Chemistry: A Tenth Edition, like previous editions, is intended for a two-semester introductory organic chemistry course. I recognize that many students in this course are biology or pre-med majors so, when appropriate, I bring in biological examples. Color is used consistently through the texts and illustrations. Problems are categorized (see below) and vary in level. My goal is to be as economical as possible with changes so that the overall length of Organic Chemistry does not increase. 2 Preface Access for free at openstax.org Changes to the tenth edition I continue to review every word and every explanation, updating many small details and improving problems where needed. My aim is always to refine the features that made earlier editions so successful, while adding new ones. Reviewer comments are also extensively considered during the reviewer process. All the problems in every chapter are also reviewed for clarity. The detailed list of changes will be available upon publication at the OpenStax website. However, the following is a list of the major changes made to the tenth edition. Chapter 6 • Polar Reactions are now covered before Radical Reactions Chapter 17 • Section 17.5: Added newly discovered reaction of Grignard reagents with carboxylic acids to prepare ketones Chapter 18 • Section 18.7: Added coverage of ionophores Chapter 19 • Section 19.5: Added coverage of alpha-keto acid hydrates Chapter 21 • Section 21.3: Added synthesis of amides by reaction of carboxylic acids and amines using (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide (EDEC) Chapter 26 • Section 26.7: Added synthesis of amides by reaction of carboxylic acids and amines using (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide (EDEC) • Section 26.8: Updated details for solid phase peptide synthesis Chapter 30 • Section 30.8: Increased coverage of Cope rearrangement • Section 30.8: New coverage of Oxy Cope reaction Chapter 31 • Section 31.6: Discuss intramolecular olefin metathesis use in ring-closing • Chemistry Matters: Discuss intramolecular olefin metathesis use in ring-closing Coverage and scope Organic Chemistry: A Tenth Edition, like previous editions, is intended for a two-semester introductory organic chemistry course.

About Statistics This instructional material was initially created through a Texas Education Agency (TEA) initiative to provide high-quality open-source instructional materials to districts free of charge. Funds were allocated by the 84th Texas Legislature (2015) for the creation of state-developed, open-source instructional materials with the request that advanced secondary courses supporting the study of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics should be prioritized. Statistics covers the scope and sequence requirements of a typical one-year statistics course. The text provides comprehensive coverage of statistical concepts, including quantitative examples, collaborative activities, and practical applications. Statistics was designed to meet and exceed the requirements of the relevant Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) (http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/rules/tac/chapter111/ch111c.html#111.47) , while allowing significant flexibility for instructors. Qualified and experienced Texas faculty were involved throughout the development process, and the textbooks were reviewed extensively to ensure effectiveness and usability in each course. Reviewers considered each resource’s clarity, accuracy, student support, assessment rigor and appropriateness, alignment to TEKS, and overall quality. Their invaluable suggestions provided the basis for continually improved material and helped to certify that the books are ready for use. Preface 1 The writers and reviewers also considered common course issues, effective teaching strategies, and student engagement to provide instructors and students with useful, supportive content and drive effective learning experiences. Coverage and Scope Statistics presents the appropriate statistical concepts and skills in a logical and engaging progression that should be familiar to faculty. Chapter 1: Sampling and Data Chapter 2: Descriptive Statistics Chapter 3: Probability Topics Chapter 4: Discrete Random Variables Chapter 5: Continuous Random Variables Chapter 6: The Normal Distribution Chapter 7: The Central Limit Theorem Chapter 8: Confidence Intervals Chapter 9: Hypothesis Testing with One Sample Chapter 10: Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples Chapter 11: The Chi-Square Distribution Chapter 12: Linear Regression and Correlation Chapter 13: F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA Flexibility Like any OpenStax content, this textbook can be modified as needed for use by the instructor depending on the needs of the students in the course. Each set of materials created by OpenStax is organized into units and chapters and can be used like a traditional textbook as the entire syllabus for each course. The materials can also be accessed in smaller chunks for more focused use with a single student or an entire class. Instructors are welcome to download and assign the PDF version of the textbook through a learning management system or can use their LMS to link students to specific chapters and sections of the book relevant to the concept being...", "metadata": {"title": "Statistics-WEB", "book": null, "chapter": null, "section": null, "split": "train"}, "timestamp_utc": "2026-01-05T19:39:13Z"}
